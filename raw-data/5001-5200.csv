"Lee Brice - I Dont Dance Great description of them guys out there that cant dance to save their 
life but lordy they live watching their women showing it off. "
"The people who dont listen to country stop commenting on our stuff If u r commenting on this and haven't listened to a country song go listen 
to rap or whatever u listen to "
"All these negative reviews r from people who don't like country music at 
all anyway so don't listen to them "
"Lee is totally awesome. I love listening to his songs. It doesn't matter 
what he sings, you feel it right along with him "

That don't sound like you The best song ever drinking class is a good one to 
NOTHINGS BETTER I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LISTENING TO COUNTRY MUSIC. I IT ALL. 
What did he do cuz u dont sound lik u anymore Awesome lee brice song hit.... 
"Alright Drinking Class and I Don't Dance are the only ones I like. Overall I don't 
like the album. The first two of his albums were the bomb tho. "
Love him. He sings from the heart. What more could you ask for? 
"Really Almost every country song is about girls, alcohol, and trucks they're 
barely any country songs that don't talk about these things "
"Worst ever Country music is formulaic n unoriginal as hell. Boring also. N this guy 
def does not break that mold. Not sure the appeal of this type of music. It 
just sucks "
Lee Brice is as talented an artist as there is I'm country music today. 
If you in breeds don't like country don't listen to it.this guy is good. 
Crap So this is what passes for country today? 
"Truck tires on a.......no, stop it I hate that song with a passion "
"This should be free, because it's crap. "
"Lee Brice is amazing Love all his songs. Real men love country. I'm in love with his song that 
dont sound like you "
"Love this song .actually has meaning and a story..unlike the rap and other 
crap they call music these days.. "
"Love it Lee Brice is a good country singer I don't listen to country often but Lee 
Brice is one if my favs. "
"Love it People who give it negative reviews its because you dont listen to country 
music and if you dont like country music then dont listen to it "
I don't dance Lee Brice 
I don't dance Remember my man of my life 
"Amazing This is a really amazing andi cab it really put it in words except its

"Why are all your albums of the week country? Give us a little mix. Not even 
for 2.99 "
Drinking class Lee Brice 
"I'm just getting started on this. This is disturbed from front to back, if You like this band you WILL be 
buying this. That's all that needs to be said but truth be put it's wicked. 
And intentionally meant this I will acquire the hardware digital version 
for its superior quality. Still curious to how some of the sound was 
constructed. Last time I heard something similar in twisted metal magnitude 
was from a FIGHT album. Ads real uniqueness Heavy metal. "
"Since I was 16, I have always loved Disturbed. Their music is awesome, 
David Drainman's voice is just so great, the ability to sing soft into 
heavy is a wonderful gift. That being said, of course my favorite song is 
The sound of Silence but the rest of the album lives up to t he hype. I 
think I just found my new soundtrack when I play W.O.W. "
"I was thrilled when I found out a new Disturbed album was coming out. I 
enjoyed the side projects but wanted more Disturbed. So glad they came back 
with such a fantastic collection of music! This album really showcases 
their range. I don't think I can pick a favorite track because they are all 
great. Put aside what you thought you knew about the band from Chicago and 
give this a listen! "
"More of the same, only get if you're a fan. While it still captures the awesome, powerful sound that first drew me to 
the band, Immortalized is even more formulaic and, if you will, safe, than 
Asylum was. I would have rather had a couple truly bad songs if it meant 
them stepping outside of their comfort zone and experimenting a little. "
"Awesome album Well worth paying for it. The Sound of Silence cover is absolutely 
amazing. It sends chills down my back every time. In my opinion, it brings 
out the tone that match the lyrics. I actually prefer this version over the 
original. "
"Was expecting more heavier stuff I was really looking forward to their heavy metal but only a few songs I 
like. Wish there was atleast a gem like Down with the Sickness on the 
Sickness album. Never Wrong is the closest feeling to the Sickness era For 
people going to buy the album keep in mind this is a different style of 
disturbed, sadly not worth the wait of the hiatus. "
"Horrible album Waste of time and money. Sounds of silence is the only good song worth 
buying off the entire album. I was really disappointed with this album. 
When immortalized came out they started to sound worse than ever. The only 
album since immortalized was the lost children. "
"Good as always You know some people may say i was expecting something different, but i 
then think about it what makes Disturbed who they are. David sings from the 
heart and not about any old nonsense. "
"Better Than Ever They have a distinct sound, but I love it. It's like rock n roll goes to 
Church: an old church that tortures heretics who wail in misery. I was 
listening to the samples and kept putting stars next to every song. "
"They are so great... The Light just gave me a purpose to go and live my 
life to the fullest.... I love your raging disturbed sound to your voice 
and this Song.... Btw The SOS was pretty amazing too guys.. Im a Fan! "
"They're back and better than ever Disturbed's hiatus was disappointing to the fans as much as the band. But 
this album proves a band can improve with rest. Every track is incredible, 
especially their take on ""Sounds of Silence"". This is a must own for all 
Disturbed fans. "
"Great album I've been listening to Disturbed since 2002 and I've never been 
disappointed with each album that has come out over the years and honestly 
this is great album . Sound of silence is my favorite off the album because 
it's so different from what I'm used to hearing from Disturbed but I love 
it over all. "
"I can't really remember the first time I heard of and heard Disturbed. But 
for sure I'm so daggone happy I did. Every Album hits its mark. If you're 
not a fan you better be. CAuse you're missing out. "
"Crazy good Ive been listening to disturbed for quite a while now and was somewhat 
disappointed with asylum but they knocked it out of the park with this one. 
Immortalized has that classic raging disturbed style, but at the same time 
the sound of silence is such a drastic change from the norm. However it 
still manages to fit in perfectly. Well done. "
"Really enjoyed first half The first half of the album has some good stuff. After that, it gets a 
little repetitive but is still good. Just not quite the edge I thought it 
would have through the whole album. "
"I'm not usually into heavy metal, but I just LOVE their rendition of Sounds 
of Silence. Powerful. Moving. And at the $.99 cent special sale price I 
found a few other new songs to enjoy. \m/ "
"Best song - the vengeful one. But all the other songs were pretty awesome 
too. Disturbed used to be like just every other band to me earlier but now 
it's my favourite band. Dot let anybody bring you guys down "
"Rock's album of the year They came back stronger than ever. The soothing cover of the Sound of 
Silence, the leading single that caught everyone's attention The Vengeful 
One, everything in the album was Disturbed but just a little bit more meat 
to each song. Can't go wrong for just 99 cents! "
"This album falls a bit short of some of the previous albums. Vengeful One, 
The Light and The Sound of Silence are the 3 best tracks for my taste and 
on par for what I am used to. The video for The Sound of Silence adds to 
the overall experience and for me I like it better than the original. "
"DISTURBED!!! I LOVED you guys yet i still do. Hail to the kings since the sickness. 
Your the best!!! Its been 4 long years since your last album the lost 
children. I bet this album will be freaking awesome as the rest or perhaps 
better! "
"Felt like throwing up This might be one of the worst things I've ever heard in my life. 
Listening to my baby cousin cry for 2 hours better. Sounds like and old man 
singing this song but its probabally just a voice changer. My point is 
wateful music and even more wasteful time "
"Yes!! After 4 long years of waiting, Disturbed is back from its hiatus. The 
Vengeful One was awesome, but I want to hear more. Im definitely gonna make 
my $11 worth it. "
"Disturbed is a the greatest metal band out right now, David can sing heavy 
or soft n still hit every note, but the best thing is they love n remember 
their fans are most important. "
"Completely worth buying, The Sound of Silence is an amazing rendition of 
Simon and Garfunkel's song, and absolutely mind blowing. They weren't 
trying to outdo the Original, but in my own opinion, in trying to pay it 
tribute, they Surpassed the Original. "
"We all know that the world was in distress the whole time they were gone. 
I've heard one track and I love it and cannot wait to hear the rest! "
"Disturbed from Chicago, Illinois have hit the motherload. The motherload 
being their best album sinced 2000's THE SICKNESS (or 2005's TEN THOUSAND 
FISTS)! Full of many different tempos, vocalizing styles, soft and hard 
speeds, this is Disturbed at their Nostalgic peak. If you are a metal fan, 
or just getting into rock, it doesn't matter. It has something for 
everyone. Ballads, screams, heartbreak and despair, love gone wrong and 
love gone right. In other words, you would be a fool no to try this one. I 
just found this song, and A SOUND OF SILENCE is probably THE BEST COVER 
DISTURBED HAS DONE!!! IT is AMAZING!!! You have done the impossible 
Disturbed, you have revived a slowly fading rock genre. Keep doing great 
guys, you have a lifelong listener born today. Give it a try. It could 
change your life. 5 OUT OF 5 STARS!!! "
"A shame If this is what they felt was justification of the hiatus, maybe they 
should have stayed there. But anything to stroke David's massive ego, 
right? "
"DISTURBED HAS AWAKEN ONCE AGAIN I love this album, been listening to it all day. It's like Sickness and 
Believe had a baby and this was it. "
"They're back! I thought Sound of Silence was going to be a harsh metal version. To my 
relief David Draimon does Simon and Garfunkel justice. "
"Just rated to comment So I bought the sound of silence and it won't play say's music play back 
error could not play the track you requested. Could some one fix this for 
me or at least refund me my money cause I've done everything thing I know 
how I've turned my phone off and on and nothing this sucks. "
"Oh my freaking God! Friend spun up the video clip for ""The Sounds Of Silence"" and that 
prompted me to listen to all of it. Bought it. "
"Why i love disturbed Being a metal and rock head i have always loved this band my favorite song 
is ten thousand fist or awaken and so glad there back and i downloaded it 
after my b day August 8 "
"Welcome back Disturbed Amazing album! Simply can't get enough of it! Although it's a bit softer 
than their previous albums but their music is absolutely addicting... Worth 
every penny & more! "
"Amazing I loved all the songs, but my favorite one would have to be the cover of 
The Sound Of Silence. And their concert in Feb. 2016 was awesome! "
Still badass They finally came back from their hiatus and I'm so glad they made this. 
"Simply amazing! This album is an amazing come back after four years. The cover song was 
beautiful and the bonus tracks were works of art. Definitely their best 
work. "
"Still got it Not sure what Brice was listening to, but this is classic Disturbed... 
Great album and so glad to see them back "
"Disturbing My friend loved this band and I thought is was a bunch of crappy metal. 
Finally I decided to check it out and they didn't dissapoint "
"Disturbed is back! Looks insane! If any of the songs are like The Vengeful One, the album 
will be the best one yet. "
"Re-fan David has caused me chills with The Sound of Silence cover of the Simon 
and Garfunkel original. Count me back in as a fan! "
"This is the Janet album I've been waiting for. I've been a huge fan of 
Janet's since I was a kid. When I picked up the Control album I was too 
young to really know who she was, what family she was a part of, or that 
she was the same actress I remember seeing on Different Strokes. All I know 
is I fell in love with her music and her videos. I've followed her career 
closely ever since, relishing every new album as a deeper glimpse into her 
persona. Unbreakable is a welcome return to the introspective, thoughtful 
songwriting that drew me to Janet in the first place. Listening to this 
album was an emotional experience for me, not one that I'll soon forget. 
Thank you Miss Jackson! "
"A Rhythm Nation/Velvet Rope hybrid. Kudos to you Janet for staying true to 
yourself and your vision, and not trying to chase trends, or try abysmally 
to remain forever youthful. To those saying 'there's no hits on here' need 
to understand she did this record for the fans, not chart success or 
relevance. She could have stayed in seclusion with her man and her 
millions. So, enjoy the mature Janet, or have several seats. "
"Undeniably excited for ""Unbreakable"" It's been a long time coming, but after a 7 year hiatus Janet is back!! I 
was a mild fan of ""No Sleeep"", but she's just released the title track as 
the second single, and it's off the chain!!! As she said in the beginning 
of Damita Jo's ""All Nite (Don't Stop""... ""This beat is sick!!"" Can't wait 
to hear the entire album!!! "
"The #StormNet is here! The beautiful storm of Janet has arrived and has awaken us from the numb 
senses of monotonous and ridiculous music that has been given to us too 
many times. I'm happy as hell she's here to show and tell us that real 
elegant, classy, and mentally and physically stimulating music is alive and 
well. #ImpactNet #AmazingNet #PowerfulNet "
"The legendary Janet has done it again! Amazing body of work that you can listen to from beginning to end I love 
EVERYTHING about this album. I don't buy albums but JJ got me groovin' so I 
HAD TO GET IT! LOVE YOU JANET JACKSON! "
"It needs me real bad. If you still wanna be in superstar mode ad in like 
forever for real. Grandmaster producer and everything you could wish for in 
Ireland Produced Michael Jackson higher non stop everyday "
"Refreshing Janet, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis....need I say more! When these three get 
together, it's nothing but magic! I gotta be real..this is not their best 
work. However, I love the innocence that I'm hearing in these tracks and 
not the over-sexed crap that is on heavy rotation on the radio. I would say 
that this album are the three musketeers getting reacquainted after a long 
suffering hiatus. However, this album is better than her last three 
debacles!! "
"Love the whole album Ms Janet makes me smile every time I hear her music. Her songs help me get 
though a rough day or help me unwind. I'm a Ms Janet Jackson Fan 4 Life "
"QUEEN JANET, QUEEN OF MUSIC I had the opportunity to see her in Florida at both the Orlando and Tampa 
shows. I got upgraded twice, and I wound up in the front row! I was blown 
away! Nobody does it like Ms. Jackson! Janet has gone on tour yet again 
without an album... and she's still selling out shows! We didn't know the 
lyrics to the new songs she performed; except No Sleeep and Unbreakable. 
However she sang them beautifully and the crowd went wild! That's a bold 
move. She's the definition of a BOSS! I can't wait until Oct. 2nd. "
"J is Back ..shd mind madge bout mashup comebk set to now At times sounding more MJ this output into world is missing any real smash 
unless they get some mad crazy work goin on. like bringing on massive 
effect or hooverphonic on shoulda known better or something like 
prodigy/aphex/emf/atom bomb band (cin city sex mix still messes with me 
earz like whoah! gone wild) goin off. take me away "
"Great. This album was very sonically impressive. Janet proves once again that her 
voice is beautiful whether she's singing softly or expressing her full 
vocal range. I really like how she experimented with different sounds yet 
still remained true to her style. Some tracks even sounded like they 
incorporated the country/folk genre, I definitely think Janet could pull 
off Country if she wanted to. This album was very positive and upbeat, and 
it made me happy to be honest. An album full of hits/chart toppers! ♡ "
"New direction Like the fresh, new but familiar sound Janet has on this album. My only 
criticism is the filter that has been used on 1 track in particular. Other 
than that...like it alot. "
"Not her best but better than today's music I'm a Janet Fan and have been since she played Penny on good times. I 
loved all of her albums from Control and up to the albums she did before 
she got with Jermaine Dupree. Didn't like her very first album though. The 
songs on this album are musical, much more so than the crap they play on 
the radio today. However the songs on this Album don't have a hit that I 
was hoping for. She needs a m A real Hot slow jam like ""Funny How Time Flys 
When your having fun"". And a fast jammy jam like Pleasure Principle. "
"I love Janet Her music will always have a special place in my heart. She is my #1. This 
album is amazing and truly different than anything she has done in the 
past. Well Traveled is my favorite! "
"Underwhelmed Janet u got rid of Jimmy & Terry for a reason. Keep things fresh w/ 
current producers next go around...Plz! I've been a fan for over 20 yrs & 
I've come to expect better from u. Not changing clothes & cutting corners 
on choreography on tour is boring as this album is. "
"Great Tracks...but don't overpay. This album is only $9.99 at Best Buy. No, I don't work for them, just 
trying to save my fellow JJ fans some money =) "
"This Woman Is Amazing She has done it again!! Creating Music that inspires and heals. I love you 
janet thank you again for this masterpiece. I'm literally in tears 
listening to it. ❤❤❤❤ Thank you thank you for being the woman, the artist, 
the survivor I appreciate all that you are. #janet4ever "
"One of Janet's best albums/cd in years! My favorite is 'Burnitup!' Love 
playing it at the club and dancing to it. Something for every Janet Jackson 
lover on this cd, slow as well as dance tunes. Load up them music players 
with this one people. "
"Don't get it! It all sound exactly the same and by that I mean every track and every 
album since the 90's. So want to see her top the charts but that's not 
gonna happen when she spits out the same stuff. "
"My girl is back. Wendy Williams, now you can choke on your own words! I cannot wait to get this. Going to try and hit Lanta to see her live as 
well. "
"Very Rare for me to do this Usually I download a few select tracks from an artist. This is one of 
those rare exceptions: I'm downloading Unbreakable & purchasing a HARD COPY 
on cd. It's been way too long. I miss you JJ. "
"Missed Janet more than I knew!!! Album..is certainly different for Janet. But I like the quiet subtle 
strength the overall Grown and Sexy Vibe. The vocals are sick... Great Job 
Miss Janet! "
"What is this? It's over, Janet. The sound is awful. The 90's are gone. Can 
someone tell her? Do her family of dancers from Rhythm Nation 1814 have leg 
braces? Give it up and simply walk away with the Jackson family name and 
keep whatever dignity you have left after that (un)planned ""nip slip."" "
"So over the 80's Nothing new that we haven't heard from her before. Same beats, same sound 
as her old stuff just different titles. Boring. "
"YASSS!! This album is soo positive! She really came through with this album. No 
interludes really. A good long solid album! I wonder if this is her last 
album. Dream Maker & Black Eagle, are my favorite. "
"Welcome back, Janet After reuniting with Jam and Lewis as producers/composers/writers Janet 
Jackson releases 'Unbreakable', one of her best albums and one of the best 
albums of the year. Janet seems to channel her sibling Michael Jackson on 
several cuts (she sounds exactly like him - a tribute I would guess & 
possibly a selling point for his fans) while singing thru an album of 
dance, techno, ballads and love songs (one of my favorites is 'Lessons 
Learned' which could be a country song). Thumbs up & welcome back, Janet! "
"Music needed this album right now. I have been listening to this all day 
over and over. She sounds fantastic, the production is top notch. I love 
the musical direction she's going towards on this album. "
"Only one good song. That's No Sleep with J Cole. I really expected Janet to 
roll with the times and pull it out. Much love Janet! Just keepin it real. "
"She did not disappoint! I loved the mellow sounds, and took me back to a 
few song from her different albums. Only Janet fans will notice :) I am so 
happy with this album! "
"Amazing album! <3 Love Janet! <3 This is such an amazing, awesome, profound album and I Love it so much! <3 
so happy she's back! : ) Love the messages too, if you really listen to the 
lyrics, she offers much wisdom about the time we are living in today : ) 
this album has been on repeat for me, definitely recommend it longtime fan 
since control and still love her and her music and always will! <3 "
"Janet! Miss Jackson if you're nasty! I'm a fan so of course I love it. Couple of boring songs but over all its 
awesome sauce! I'm buying it! "
"Ms. Janet no more nasty I miss the old sound and the old style. The concert brought some life to 
the album but not her best. The old songs had me moving. I got my cardio 
on! Therefore, I'm still a fan. "
"Loves this Album I will be putting this album on repeat for a long time. Thank you Ms. 
Jackson. It's so energetic and has its moments of cool relaxing And then 
it's moments of meaningfulness. It's such a beautiful album. "
"Janet, You sound Great!!! Despite what people are saying, I like this album. It's very versatile and 
actually sounds good and that is coming from a harsh critic!!! Me... "
"The queen is back I have only heard 3 songs but I already know that this album is going to 
be amazing. Janet ALWAYS SLAYS. "
Queen She's back .. Making statements.. Sounding better than ever 
"Love It! This album has some great potential for awesome remixes for clubs. Damnn 
Baby is just crazy! That's my favorite. "
"to be honest I had no idea what to expect with this album. in order to 
appreciate this album you'd have to appreciate Janet & how much she's grown 
since 7 years ago..omg it's mature..the beats vibe..it's smooth..it's 
just..I don't know how to explain it..I feel like this album is an album 
that appreciates music & the growth that comes from it.. "
"This deserves to be #1 Favorite album so far ever since Velvet Rope. Janet's back and she's 
slaying me already. Love ya Janet! ❤ "
"Ubreakable Great album Ms. Janet with a fresh sound and a few funk sounds !!! Now I 
have some really upbeat ear candy to add to my mp3 folder Titled: Driving 
Music, Work Out Music, My Chill Music and Party Music. Ms. Janet you have a 
few sounds on your album that put me back in the Funk Era. And than with 
your Alto/ Soprano voice you fast forward to a more current theme putting 
your Ms. Janet flavor stamp on it, which only proves that you are truly a 
professional business woman who can cover every Genere. ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ "
"Sums it up I have listened to music for as long as I can remember. It has been the 
best medicine for my soul. Dierks Bentley is the one artist that I can 
honestly say has brought the connection of music and my life to a sum. So 
diverse, yet so profound. Great work, man. Keep those albums coming. You'll 
always have at least one faithful fan. "
"Perfection Bentley came back at with his finest, most honest, emotional, and 
brilliant album yet. Every song hits its mark because Bentley puts his 
heart and soul into his music. This album will never grow old, and the 
connection I have with the album will never fade. Buy it and you'll fall in 
love. "
"Okay His album Home is one of my all time favorite country albums. So I had 
high hopes for this one. It unfortunately fell short of my expectations. I 
should have known this was going to be the case, because dierks didn't work 
with the same writer in extent as he did with home. "
"Dierks Bentley is my favorite artist ever His song riser completely explains me I looked this song up and he wrote 
it after his dad past away I completely understand what's he's going 
through my name is Michelle and my mom past away and I am only 10 years old 
love you Dierks Bentley your my hero "
"Classic Dierks All this time and this guy still can't put out a bad album. Thanks 
brother, everyone else is going away and you're a steady place for country 
to stay. "
"SO worth the wait! This album is absolutely incredible! I've always been a fan of Dierks and 
I thought I couldn't love his music more until I bought this album. I love 
his style and sound. The writing is fantastic! I love it! "
Nothing like this I fell in love with this song the minute I heard it 
"Inspirational This album really speaks to me.. Every song is deep and heartfelt. I'd 
have to say riser is my favorite song from the album. Love playing it on my 
guitar and singing it. Great job Dierks; always been a fan. "
"Survivor ""Riser"" is one of my very favorite songs. I get chills everytime and 
whenever I hear it, it always seems to light a fire inside and remind me 
how much I've made it through. It's truly a song that'll remind you of your 
strength. "
"Great album Its great to hear actual heartfelt songs written by artists. Dierks is a 
great example of a singer who puts everything in his music. Here on earth 
is a very deep emotional song and its refreshing to see this in todays 
music. "
"Love this Album Dierks is amazing love this album but I think my favorite is I Hold On I 
don't think I could ever here that song enough. Saw him sing it live in 
concert last year and have been in love with it ever since. "
My favorite songs got to be Drunk on a plane and I hold on :-) :-) :-) I like this album 
"We are losing Country. How is this at 194, Dierks is the best artist on here, so many noncountry 
posers out there. He should be in the top 10 at least. #1 in my book. "
"AWSOME Dierks Bentley is amazing! I have always loved country music. My favorite 
song of his right now is Hold On "
"Song is i hold onThis is an insperratoin to me and I ♥your sining I wanna be a country or pop sining when I grow up thank u my favorite song

"Love it I love it but you need to make a trial for as long as u want it or just 
free nut no you have to make it so expensive for some people need to lower 
it down to 1 cent or some thing I want it but I dont have enough money to 
buy it I would give it a 1 but I loveit to much "
"Great Dierks really hit a home run with this album. I'm a fan or Eric church... 
But I can't stop listening to this. "
Drunk on a planr Great song I have felt like that several times myself 
"Fantastic! Say You Do is so addictive! Gorgeous video and find myself singing it all 
the time! Can't get it out of my head. Just love it. "
"So great! I've always loved Dierks but this album is the best one yet!! He's a true 
Country singer. He just gets better and better!!!! "
