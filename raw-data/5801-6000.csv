Stolen dance is totes the best one out of these 
I'm madly in love with this album 
Savage album :-) 
Love it 
"It's perfect, and Kacey Musgraves is such an incredibly talented artist. 
This music just sounds 'American', it's sincere, it comes from her heart 
and it isn't made for commercial success and that's what makes it special 
and rare. Every single song on here is a win. She writes music that has 
something to say about society, but she does it in an incredibly 
intelligent way and that's so rare. "
"Kacey Musgraves, will you please just marry me. I've fallen in love with your music. This album is absolutely amazing. 
Each song speaks to me in a different way. It's brilliant. Keep up the 
amazing work beautiful!! "
"BEST COUNTRY ALBUM I OWN! Seriously, this album is pure gold. Her lyrical style is clever, creative, 
witty, and relatable from track to track. If you liked ""Same Trailer 
Different Park"" you will love this album! I can't stop listening to this 
album. "
"Yes! I've fallen in love with Kacey music since she first started. I look 
forward to many more awesome tracks! "
"Absolutely Awesome!!! Her voice is so mesmerizing. Breathing a fresh breath of country in a time 
of popraprock crap on the country radios today. "
"Amazing I love every song. Kacey Musgraves couldn't have made it any better. The 
best album ever created. "
"Pageant Material One of the best albums of the year in my opinion. Every track really good, 
I am not surprised it has had such good reviews "
"Amazing This album is all the music I didn't know I needed. Even if you're not a 
country music fan download this. You won't regret it! "
"Reminds me of Mandy Moore's last two albums. Some poignant, some hysterical. Nice music. "
"This album is musical Sunshine This is a fun, soulful, and refreshing country album. Staying true to a 
genre while infusing her own style. Smart writing and a nice sound to go 
with it. "
Please keep the style you are doing We don't want another Taylor Swift 
Quit erasing my stars Now when I push that summit thingy it goes A way. FIX PLEAS 
"Perfection Greatest female country album in the last 10 years. Actually, male or 
female. The writing is unlike anything you hear on the radio. And she's not 
yelling at the top of her lungs. She's singing. "
Country music gold! Actual county music!! I am obsessed with her sound. 
I don't even like country ;-) Refreshing country tunes with a (very welcome) smart edge. 
"I wish every country singer out there today would listen to this album to 
know how to do Country Music in this day and time. "
Pure country Love her...and it not pop ..it's actually country 
True country music at it's heart. My favorite album of the year so far. 
"Kasey Musgraves Love, Love, Love her! Amazing song writter, Amazing voice, chill 
personality, would love to hang out with her! "
"So catchy! Kacey is a brilliant songwriter. I love the story-like flow and meaning 
behind her songs. "
"Scary good Its like that lauren hill song. She took pages from my diary and put them 
into songs. "
"I'll be playing this album on repeat allllll day for at least the next 
month prob longer. It's that good. "
"I love Kacey's sound, and all of her songs sound like they are all felt 
from the heart. Love it "
The princess had a prime Alejandra 
Love her. Great voice and song writing! Can't stop listening to it! 
"Pageant Material Really excellent album, stunning voice, fun lyrics also. Great buy! "
Epic Always have liked me some Kacey Musgraves ... Love this album 
"Love it Grammy award winning Kacey Musgraves did not dissapoint with her sophomore 
album!! Love it "
This is the hi Beverly to the party way to the party with you 
Love! Love every song she has! Such a great album. Love all her quirky lyrics! 
"Love her! Kacey sings passionately and beautifully. Her lyrics are relatable and 
clever! "
"Fun album. She put on a great show at Bonnaroo 2015 as well. She will be 
around for a while. "
Love Kacey since day 1 A masterpiece enough said. 
Somebody to Love Ugh can't get enough of this album 
Great Artist This artist just keeps getting better with experience. 
I don't like country music. But I love this album. Classic. 
Loved it! I love Kacey Musgraves. She is awesome 
Fun tumes Old time country fun with a modern tude 
اهنگخیلی باحاله
Country Music ok 
"Unsurpassable? I was about 11 when I first heard this album and it's one or the albums I 
still regularly listen to today. Other albums come and go, but this one is 
never getting old. RIP Cliff, immortal through song \m/ "
"Master Of Puppets RIP Cliff Burton. 'Master of Puppets' is simply the anthem of thrash 
metal. It's a shame the production was so sh*t that the bass line could 
never be heard... But then again Bob Rock didnt do much better by turning 
them into Bon Jovi with the 'black' album... "
"Love it Kids these days listen to pop and this is my reaction me: WHAT THE HELL IS 
THIS CRAP!?! idiot who listens to pop: it's music me: playing one string 
during the entire song is not music... Metallica is music idiot who listens 
to pop: what about call me maybe me:(thinking to myself) you better f###ing 
be joking (what I say) go listen to some guns'n'roses "
"Backdrop of the 80's For the longest time I've thought of Metallica as a mainstream heavy metal 
band that was mainly a phenomenon of the 90's because their Black Album is 
what is always played on the radio. I was aware they had a back catalogue 
reaching into the 80's, but I had no idea they had such a seminal influence 
on heavy metal in that period. Probably much of the heavy metal I heard 
others listen to in the 80's was from this album - I just never realized, 
until now! "
"Metallica at its best In my opinion their best album by far. Master of Puppets is the album that 
helped change Speed/Thrash Metal and made Metallica one of the big four 
along with Megadeath, Anthrax and Slayer. Master of Puppets, Battery and 
Disposable Heros are fan favourites and all over tracks keep the album nice 
and ballanced. This album is on top of their top 3 along with The Black 
Album and Death Magnetic, respectivly "
"Masters of puppets An absolute classic must have I think there best album ever but 
unfortunately the last with cliff (rip).but credit to the remaining members 
for continuing to make millions of people. Happy. "
"Superb This album along with and justice for all are Metallica at their best. 
Just a shame that the bass line can't be heard on both albums "
"Come crawling faster ! Obey your master. Your life burns faster. Obey your master. Master! Master 
of the puppets I'm pulling your stings ! "
"Finest metal album ever I loved it when growing up and still listen to it now never get tired of 
it.....work of art!!! "
"Astonishing Words cannot really describe what this album means to metal music. One of 
the most influencing group created one of the most influencing album in 
metal history. It should be among the top 50 metal albums ever created. "
"The pinnacle of metal 1986 was the best year for metal music. This album is at the forefront of 
the best of the best. Love it! "
"Apparently this is Pop One of my favourite Metallica albums. Loving that play store has its genre 
listed as pop. Lol "
"Keith Best metal album ever. Possibly the best piece of guitar work and 
production methodology of the 80's. Anyone who likes metal/ rock from any 
era needs to get this album. "
"The greatest, heaviest Metallica album ever. My all time favourite. Every 
single is absolute gold. "
"My favorite metallica album no bands could beat this album but Sadly best 
bass player ever cliff Burtons last album "
"Master of metals albums Suatu hari di Dunia Fantasi, sedang berlangsung kontes musik metal. Master 
of puppets jadi lagu wajib yg mesti dimainkan. Saat itu, saya msh kelas 6 
sd, tahun 1987. Sementara temen2 asyik naik wahana, saya nongkrong di depan 
panggung hanya untuk menyaksikan MOP dimainkan lagi dan lagi... "
Completely Overated Though Fantastic album but Ride the Lightning is a way better album. 
None needed! If you love metal or thrash buy this NOW! 
Great One of Metallica's best if not the best 
"Best album ever You can't beat classic Metallica for power and great songs, and this album 
was the best of the lot. "
"Incredible album This and ...and justice for all are best metallica albums,i mean some of 
the best albums i ever heard "
Great album Classic album. Strange that it's rated as pop. 
Master of Puppets The lead track is the Epitome of Metal. 
"The self titled track to this recording is like the song describes a 
masterpiece. Still no.1 "
No1. Metall Album Of All Time 
One of the master pieces of the Rock History 
Buy now!!!!! Are you listening loud? 
"Metallica's finest album. Love every song. Let's hope the new album is as 
good "
Metallica/songs;Master YouTube/music 2016. 
"Epic No need, just buy it. "
METALLICA - LEGEND'S OF METAL 
Amazing I think this is one of the best album that Metallica has. That‘s it. 
Awesome Best metal thing ever 
"Why is this album classified as ""Pop""? "
Master Of puppets 
Metallica Master of puppets 
MASTER MASTER!! Definitely One of my Favourite Metallica Album's 
Master of puppets A real classic from a legendary band 
Iron maiden is better just get their album 
Wow! 
"Pink Floyd - dark side of the moon A wonderful enlightenment to the mellow side of music. Kick back relax 
turn up your stereo. Enjoy this work off art. Play once & you will like. 
Play again you will begin to be drawn in. Keep playing then you realise 
this release is a true masterpiece for everyone to enjoy. If you like Led 
Zeppelin - going to California . You will need to purchase this too. 
Harmonious heaven. Enjoy. "
"Sweet! Their best by far! wow! This is crazy, especially since I've been looking at Pink Floyd's 
music trying to decide who had the better price. Ha! You guys made that 
choice and this is the album I wanted. Every album and CD of theirs I've 
owned has sprouted legs and disappeared. This one will be mind forever! "
"To the obvious minimal ""Anything below 5 *'s"" You must be a child. Therefore since the actual music and actual art 
sounds so good that it scares the diapers off of you then yeah I 
understand. But learn something about art in its true form. The best of the 
best is here. Its Pink Floyd ...I need not say more. I'm a musician. 30 out 
of my 41 years of age. Though I listen to much more subtle than my younger 
age I never since my mom played the wall when I was 4 and first heard it I 
sang it everywhere. School is out. Peace! From your teacher:-) "
"A modern classic I don't know of any other album that has stood up to the test of time (see 
what I did there?) more than The Dark Side of the Moon. Though it was 
released in 1973, it was still relevant in the 90's, when I was a teenager, 
and still is today. Very few artists can match the level of musicianship 
that went into crafting these songs. I for see this album still being 
played hundreds of years from now. And if the band you're in starts playing 
different tunes, I'll see you on the dark side of the moon. "
"Great, but Pink Floyd's Best? For the longest time, this was in my favorite Pink Floyd album, and in my 
top 10. I've found an album by them I prefer, and this one isn't in my top 
10 anymore, but it is still a great album for sure. The instrumentals don't 
do much outside the album, but songs like Breathe, Time, Money and Us And 
Them are among the Floyd's best. Iv'e always found Great Gig and Brain 
Damage overrated, but the album still deserves to be called one of the best 
of all time. "
"Good Old Days Back in 73, when I graduated high school, this album had just come out. 
The student addressing the crowd used lyrics from some of these songs at 
commencement. ""10 years have gone by, I missed the starting gun"",,, stuff 
like that. I didnt have any nice stereo equipment back then so I never 
really heard this Album like Im hearing it today,, AWESOME ! "
"THE FIRST TIME IN a few days. I have time to Listen to Some Great Music and 
Relax A little bit of time? Some things you should have to Listen to it The wall and Dark side of the 
moon! Are some really good Tune's! includes my Opinion! :-) Thank you! "
"Good stuff Their first huge hit album. I prefer the whimsy of wish you were here 
but..how can 50 million listeners be wrong..dark sides back k catalogue 
I.e. releases previous to the moon are like obscure demos meets elaborate 
intellectual aural excursions. Hearing them ALL is on the list of things to 
do before you die! "
"The Dark Side Of The Moon Pink Floyd will always Be Relaxing & True To Your Soul music.Whenever, I 
hear 1 of their songs. I feel as though I'm free of living in this Over 
Complicated world 2015. The 70's & early 80's are Magical To Me. "
"Well tasty I listened to this on Telly and loved/liked it. Well good .. wont buy the 
whole Album as I cant afford it but they deserve some money off me so I'll 
buy just one track and thats got to be Us and them 7mins for 99p is a great 
value ratio. Far better than Bieber or Aguilera where you are likely, at 
best, to get 4 mins for 99p. Be better if they gave a digital download to 
all those who give up the original album/Cassette. And free artwork , yus, 
yus,free artwork, to anybody who has farted Pie'n'Eels within looking 
distance Of Battersea Power station. "
"Amazing Album this album is meant to be listened all the way through in one sitting. 
Well... all their albums are pretty much that way, but hands down one of 
the best music pieces ever created. I cant believe I missed the .99cent 
sell :(( "
"Dark side of the moon Great electronic and synthesizers sounds. Back in the 1970s, Pink Floyd 
was a rock band with progressive sounds and great lyrics. Money, time, 
shine on you... are great songs and good examples of what I'm talking 
about. I will never get tired of listening Pink's dark side album songs. "
"All time favourite album I'm a huge metal head but Pink Floyd is my all time favourite band and 
this my my favourite album. I get chills throughout the album. David 
Gilmour's guitar work is unmatched. You can tell that the whole band had a 
creative opinion during creation of it and not controlled by Rogers. "
"To Those Who Put One Star You're entitled to your own opinion and I respect your opinion, but I 
still hope you die a very long and painful death. Like swimming through a 
pool of tabasco sauce and razor blades. Or dying of lack of oxygen in The 
Dark Side Of The Moon, or any side of the moon. "
"WOW!! OMG only .99¢ today I can't believe I got one of the great albums of all time for $0.99 today 
I had actually forgot about this album until I saw it advertised in the 
other day instantly brought back great memories and I need the music was 
good without even listening to it again. Now I'm listening to it in a way I 
never was able to back in the 70's as a teenager "
"Number 1 If we were to represent humanity as a whole with a single album, this 
would be the album. Was on the charts for 15 years straight, fell off and 
came right back on. Musical perfection. "
"A flawless recording! Not only incredibly textured in its production but don't forget, this was 
done before the digitalization of keyboards, so all the layers are looped 
basically manually. Check out the documentary on the recording with 
comments by the band members. Pink Floyd stand alone! "
"THE GREAT PINK FLOYD I tripped to it many times, including their concert,Wheeling, WV. Syd 
Barrett,1st of the founding members, 1st guitarist for Pink Floyd and also 
is the father of the light shows, crazy guitar and keyboard sounds that you 
hear today, Roger Waters went crazy just like Syd did but not to Syd's 
extreme. Roger thought the group was his and they argued a lot for DSOTM 
and The Wall. Roger doesn't like people, hence, The Wall. The Wall was a 
little about Syd and a lot about him (Roger). Wish You Were Here was Syd. "
"Greatest album Unfortunately Google music player does not support gapless play mode. The 
album was designed to play gaplessly as in the phono LP. The silent gaps 
introduced by the player at the wrong spot ruin the album. Google, please 
add gapless mode option to the player. "
"Awesome album from one of the greatest bands! Only $0.99 for today, had to jump on it. The whiney kids who were raised 
on bubblegum pop and don't know what good music is can safely be ignored. "
"Another great pink Floyd album especially the 2 tracks at the end, brain 
damage/eclipse but not their best. This is looked at to be one of the best 
albums of all time and I don't think it matches up with reviews. Still 
nothing wrong with it but I'd take The Wall any day of the week over this "
"Any Colour You Like With the release of DSOTM, Pink Floyd hit the big time, and really began 
to mature. Dealing with themes of greed and madness, this is widely hailed 
as one of the best albums of all time. It's got something for every body. "
"Pink Floyd I'm over joyed They have their own unique sound. Next to The Wall album they did this is 
right up there at the top. I have the CD I've played it so much. I never 
get tired of it. "
"One of the best albums ever I orginally thought this was going to be less experimental then albums 
like Atom Mother Heart and Meddle and be more cathered to radio. While it's 
not as experimental as those two albums it's easily as amazing if not 
better then them. I loved Dark Side Of The Moon from start to finish. If 
you've never heard a Pink Floyd album please do me a favor and purchase. 
And especially since it's only 99 cents for now. It'll be the best 99 cents 
ever spent. "
"A Masterpiece I'm usually not one to like classic rock, but this is definitely one of my 
favorite albums of all time. The way it talks about life in general, rather 
than ones own personal life is amazingly well executed. "
"Love Pink Floyd, hate Google Music I bought this album when I saw it on sale. Should have known that Google 
only has streaming services instead of a service that downloads to your 
device. Ridiculous. "
"Best The best album I have ever listened to. I'm 14 years old and I appreciate 
good music, better than all the garbage on the radio today. I own hard 
copies of Sgt pepper's the white album and all of led zepplin and the rest 
of pink Floyd and this is the best "
"DSOTM Don't need to buy it because I already have it, but thought I'd recommend 
The Wall and Meddle. Two other great Floyd albums :) "
"I dont want to be that guy, but... I honestly don't see how people can like this so much. Now don't get me 
wrong, I didn't hate this, but for the album to get 4.9 stars... That 
amazes me. It's OK. "
"Absolutely in the top full albums, all genres borrow/bene. from, changed my 
life. Absolutely the best all around in about every way, still the only album 
that I will not play unlessits start to end, load with good surround sound, 
for their full effect, feel like its to be listened to from 0.00 to the 
end, and if ever possible, bust out wizard of oz(set up dark side of the of 
the rainbow), lil psychedelics, once in a while, not always! as i feel it 
takes away from your audio appreciation, making it more of a 3/4 visual 
ratio. Plus it doesn't do too well on "
"Awesome band! I fell in love with Pink Floyd back in the 70's, and though I never had 
the chance to see them live, they have been a part of my daily music since. "
"Very good so mush heart Well sorry you don't like good music. It's probley older than you . So 
Borden your mind you mite learn something good... "
"Time and the white light splitting. I know just how old this album is. Its held up way better than I have. And 
by the way, they are all pink, but that's later. "
"Dark side...... Fires up deep seated emotions. I'm not convinced that Dark side of the 
Moon is their most haunting work,whilst personally I think that accolade 
should possibly go to Meddle and although Clarkson often rants about a 
particular car(!)being say,Ferrari's'Dark side of the moon' car....I think 
many would argue that ""The Wall""deserves the top spot..well,it's overall a 
marvel of musical elegance..with timeless appeal. "
"As classic as it gets Dark Side of the Moon is one of those rare albums -- alongside such works 
as Sgt Pepper, Fragile, Led Zep 4, Who's Next, Days of Future Passed, and A 
Night at the Opera -- that not only defined the phrases ""classic rock"" and 
""progressive rock"", they shaped the rock music landscape for years (even 
decades) to come. For $.99, if you don't already own this musical landmark, 
you no longer have any reason to live in shame. "
"Mark Andrews One of the best bands on the planet if not THE best. This album is a 
classic and their best work in the early years and deserves a place in ANY 
music collection. "
"This album makes me cry I love this sound! Always I listen this album emotions take myself and I 
feel that the world is falling trought myself... I can't explain what kind 
of emotions I taste... "
"Best album bar none All time classic album 10 times better than anything the Beatles did, 
every track a masterpiece. Can't believe over 40 years old. "
"R U kidding? Quite possibly one of the top 3 rock albums of all time. It's definitely 
one of those ""where were you when this came out"" records. And at $.99? Duh. "
"Best concert too This is one of my favorite albums. I'm 34. & out of the many concerts I 
went to when I was younger, this one was my favorite! (Note:this is not a 
live albumb, I was just saying in reference to when its songs where topping 
the charts, the related concert around that time was also great!) If you 
love ANY classic rock this is a must own for your library. Its also 
relaxing, in my point of view. Ahead of its time instrumental ;-) "
"A modern classic! Now usually, my playlist consists of a heady mix of various rock and metal 
artists, but what I do appreciate is real music with true soul, and this 
album is no exception. Lana's voice sounds and feels like whiskey soaked 
silk and she is unashamedly brutal, whilst still managing to maintain an 
air of athearal elegance! If you've not heard this album yet, you 
absolutely should! 10 stars if I could, would recommend!! "
"Great album This is probably my favourite album from 2014, stand out tracks are: 1 to 
5 and The Other Woman. I thought West Coast was a weak single but in the 
context of the whole album it works well. I much prefer this one to Born to 
Die. It would have been great if they included the song from Maleficent 
here too. "
"lana del la Reina she is the queen, her words penetrate deeper than truth. love her music. 
old money lol sounds like she starts out singing Romeo and juliet theme 
song. old money ? as in the capulets etc? lol . good one. or maybe i just 
have a fine tuned ear either way.. shes a genius. "
"Unexpected I don't listen to Lana, i have only heard the Summertime Sadness Cedric 
Gervais remix. I thought that the production was great. My favorites were 
Ultraviolence, Cruel World, West Coast, Brooklyn Baby, and Shades of Cool. 
While it wasn't the conventional upbeat tempo of most of the songs I listen 
to, the album distinguishes itself from others, making it an interesting 
listening experience. Well done. "
"Spectacular This album brings much more to ponder on unlike her previous work. Lana 
out does herself for sure but many say that the album's songs are boring or 
dull. I think otherwise, the story each song tells ultimately weaves 
together with all of her other song's stories to recreate the painting that 
is Lizzy Grant's life from her rise to fame to even jer downfalls. Overall, 
the album delivers in every way possible, highly recommend to anyone who 
wants to sit and think or just sing along. "
"MYSTIC I could listen to this on repeat forever. Although, it did have some 
worrying domestic violence glorifying lyrics - ""...he hit me and it felt 
like a kiss..."" I think her voice is amazing and she's maturing as an 
artist. That said, I illegally downloaded the entire thing. "
"Sorry I will try to forget this album even exists because I love her so much. 
But I couldn't find even one song on this album that I liked enough to play 
all the way through. Too slow and depressing in a pitiful way, not a 
romanticized depression like her old songs. "
"Lana is The queen She is like a goddess with an angel given voice. I want that album so bad! 
❤❤❤❤ As i said Nobody can get better than Lana and her incredible powerful 
glorious songs! "
"I thought she was overrated until I heard this album Now I completely regret saying I ever though that about her. The first 
song I heard off this album was ""Brooklyn Baby"" and I felt something I had 
not felt in a VERY long time from any music I've heard. You can hear so 
much emotion in her voice...it is just so beautiful and haunting at the 
same time. Lana is the artist of this generation, she has elegance and 
style that goes way and beyond any current artists. There's no match to 
this lady ♡ "
"The Goddess delivers!!!! I have been listening to Lana since Born To Die, and this by far is her 
best album! Once I heard the leak of Black Beauty way back when and West 
Coast when she was at Coachella, I knew this album would be a hit. Anyways 
this album truly deserves 5 stars because this is what she is meant to 
sing. If you are on the fence about getting this album, with all due 
respect, you aren't a true Lana fan. "
"Love. Authentic and raw, she sings for other people, she sings their stories and 
passions. In this album she dropped the urbanish beats (used in BTD) and 
changed styles as it becomes more soft rockish. Absolutely love her and her 
music. "
"Strange but awesome !! This Woman never ceases to amaze me with her sultry, raw, awe inspiring 
musical talent and passion for life. A great ""relaxing"" effect whenever I 
listen to her music. Peculiarly mesmerising & relieves the frustrations and 
stress of the rush hour drive. "
"Loving the Ultraviolence era Well done to Lana, the only original artist out there! She has blown me 
away! Ignore the critics. She deserves every grammy/award "
"Listened for hours with my girl. We played one of her albums woke Chillin' and grillin' on the deck. Good 
times! "
"Lana slays once again The album is amazing, each and every song is amazingly strong too. I loved 
Born To Die, but Ultraviolence is even better "
"Lana does it again Lana includes a song for every mood and emotion, her voice is perfect. My 
faves are Old Money and Shades of Cool. Not ashamed to say I cried 
throughout several songs. My fave artist of all time. "
"Lana del Ray Lana del Ray takes you on a sonic ride through a complicated tapestry of 
love, sex, exploitation, envy and violence. Her voice drips over the 
swirling production of Black Keys master guitarist Dan Aurbach. All this 
while being made in Nashville during Mr Aurbach's divorce. Lana ' s lush 
voice is the perfect backdrop for her tales of unalarmed pathos. She is the 
female Nero crooning while her world burns down. Her and Aurbach elevate 
this effort to an immensely more sophisticated place than Born to Di "
"Slaying Once Again Lana makes another great album that is filled with brilliant songs. My 
personal favorites are West Coast, Ultraviolence, and Brooklyn Baby. This 
is a fantastic album, I highly recommend! "
"Love lana but not Google music I bought an album here one time just to find out that I can't download it 
to my computer. You basically own the album to be able to stream it with 
Google music. Ridiculous "
"Sadcore prom One of the things I really dig about Lana Del Rey besides her being an 
extremely sexy and pouty type chick, is that she re-creates this fifties 
sixties type vibe with her music, mixing into the new millennia sound and 
makes it her own. She's not breaking any new ground but she's definitely 
making it fresh and sexy. And her lyrics are very clever dark funny and 
weird. Keep doing your thing woman your doing it good! "
"LANA DEL SLAY HAS DONE IT AGAIN! The album is great, every song is brilliant, and is definitely worth the 
purchase. My favourite songs on the album are Florida Kilos, Brooklyn Baby 
and Cruel World. "
"Ultraviolence LP Ultraviolence is an outstanding, melancholy, and beautiful 2nd record with 
haunting songs like 'cruel world' 'pretty when you cry' and 
'ultraviolence'. Although if you really want good sound, then support your 
local record shop by purchasing the vinyl. Vinyl is always better than 
download ✌ "
"This should of win grammy So many artists had this album in their list of best albums of the year, 
from heavy metal to country but it doesn't win the Grammy what?? "
"Haters gonna hate Lana can sing. She can sing live, its not auto tune. She has talent so get 
over it, BEAUTIFUL ALBUM "
"Q U E E N O F S L A Y I loved paradise / born to die and this album is amazing! I listen to a 
lot of bands and this album is my favourite by far! If you do like Lana a 
lot, then I would buy with out a doubt; however this album , as some people 
would say, is ""more misserable "" ... But it's amazing, it just depends what 
you like "
"Wow Literally every song on this album is amazing. Personal favourites are 
ultraviolence, brooklyn baby, west coast and pale moonlight. Ah heck, 
they're all my favourite! "
"Excellent Album Was kind of scared when some paper reviews said things like ""new sound "" 
to this album, there is slightly on certain tracks musically but the whole 
album is still very much Lana all over. Love it! "
"Amazing! Didnt think she could do better than Born to Die but she has nailed it. 
Cant stop listening "
"Brilliant Lana Del Rey does not disappoint. Such emotional, dark, beautiful songs. 
My personal favorites are The Other Women, Pretty When You Cry, and Cruel 
World. "
"Words can't even explain (: This album is one of her best! She's the best, I truly love Lana Del Rey<3 
She's original, and every song she sings has emotion and a message to it. 
That's a true artist + the queen! "
"Not great I loved her first album and her songs on YouTube that were never published 
but this just wasn't as good as they were. "
"AMAZING SHES AN ANGEL HER VOICE IS HEAVENLY. HER MUSIC MAKES YOU FEEL HER PAIN AND 
ITS JUST AMAZING FLAT OUT! "
"Lana sucks. She sings good. Just can't stand mainstream bs. Listen to Of Mice & Men. 
That's where its at. "
"BUY IT NOW Best fuckin album ive ever listened to. I CANT SKIP ANY SONGS ON THIS 
ALBUM!!! Literally I enjoy listening to all of these songs. Definately a 
must buy. Such a beautiful voice and unique talent. "
"Awesome. Too bad Google won't let me download it again, even though I paid 
for it. See title. Love the album. Play music sucks. "
"Beautiful & Mesmerising The Woman Is A Goddess with Vocals that really draw you in and make you 
get lost in her music "
"One of the few who still makes meaningful music. Nowadays that's hard to 
come by.. far and few between! This album (as well as her others) deserves 
many awards, I don't know what they were thinking... "
"Fantastic artist Love Lana and love this price, my wife paid £10.99 on iTunes; a mere £4.99 
on Play worth every penny! "
"You've done it again, Lana. As expected, this album was perfection. Although not as good as Born To 
Die, its absolutely incredible and definitely worth buying. Can't wait for 
the tour. "
"This is the standard This album reminds me of the greatest bands of the 90's with vibes of the 
70's turned into something new and original. Its just the best album I've 
ever heard, yes that's a strong statement and i stand by it. Love me some 
Lana "
"King of Country !! So proud to say that my 15 yr old daughter and I were 2 of the very lucky 
fans in That Att Stadium the Night that The Cowboy Rode Away.. Very 
emotional night for me... No other singer will ever reach the height in my 
heart like None other Than The King of Country... Mr. George Strait... "
"Fool hearted memory George Straight has always been a number 1 song writer/performer. I can 
relate 2 a lot of his songs. "
"George strait is my favorite singer by far. Except they jacked up ocean 
front property and it sounds terrible "
"The Best Ever Cried so many times when I saw him in Vegas. Just watched Cowboy Rides 
Away on CMT. Cried again. So good. Miss you George. "
"George Strait - The Cowboy Rides Away: Live From AT&T Stadium King George shares performances from some of his greatest hits on what is 
the last concert from his last tour breaking records along the way for the 
most people attending an indoor arena concert. "
"What a night!! Amazing so glad I was one of the lucky people to be there! Still get goose 
bumps when I hear him sing cowboy rides away "
The cowboy rides away George Strait's last concert. A tear jerker. Loved the performance! 
"The Cowboy Rides Away Run is my favorite song on this album! I love all of your music. You are 
truly one of the greatest artist to come along. Thank you! "
