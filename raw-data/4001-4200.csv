"I LOVE HER SONGS!! Her voice is so beautiful!! I love the sound that she makes!! And my 
favorite song is ex's and oh's bcuz it's soo catchy!!! "
BULLSHIT SONGS most of all xs and ohs 
"Bought it but didn't get it! I purchased this song, you took the money and it will not download "
"Amazing sound!!! I don't quite know how to describe her raspy rocking country sound and 
doing justice. I know for sure she's got a new fan . "
"One of the best debut albums ever! Listen start to finish, it's an 
experience, not just songs gathered together. LOVE ELLE!! Bring us more 
girl! "
"Just heard Elle King on The Late Late Show with James Corden. Immediately 
bought the album. Love it! "
"New and great! Great to know great new music is still coming out!!!! Love the raspy 
voice! Will be a fan! "
Crap Bought this three times and it wont play 
"Fun song It's corny, but you got to love it! "
I love this song! EX'S AND OHS I really recommend buying EX'S AND OHS because it is the BEST SONG EVER!!! 
Amazing I've been waiting ages for a full length album ! 
"Love it! My aunt past last March. You help me stay strong throughout my surgeries. 
Thank you Elle! "
Problem My song isn't working 
"Ugly lyrics, ugly songs "
Amazing She's fresh and new!!! She's been my favorite artist for a awhile! 
"Under the Influence Great song, love her style and Ora "
"I love this song but now it's gone nowhere to be found on my phone and I'm 
angry!! This song is an anthem "
Elle King Beautiful new album. Right twangy sound for a quirky woman. 
"Two things 1. Suzanne collins should write a book from Peetas point of view 
during this whole fiasco. 2. Every time i hear this song i think of poor 
Philip Semour Hoffman, who died just a week before filming was complete. 
May he R.I.P. He was a great actor in his part of Plutarch Heavensbee, the 
movie was dedicated to him, he lived an amazingly beautiful life. "
"Hanging tree is a great song but... The only problem with the song is that the volume it was recorded at isn't 
high enough because I have to turn it up a lot higher on that song than any 
of my other songs. It's just super quiet but works great with head phones! "
"Amazing! The song The Hanging Tree was amazing! My spanish teacher's son's 
girlfriend was an extra and also she sung the high ""ahhhh""'s at the end and 
it gave it a new level of amazing. Truy love the trilogy and the songs. I 
cannot express in words how addicted I am to this song and trilogy. "
"Beautiful score :) I first heard The Hanging Tree on the local pop station. It was a 
different variation but enough to make me want to buy the song. I like this 
version better. It's the strings. I'm a sucker for a movie orchestral 
piece. Well, this score was so moving, it made me tear up a little. I 
already love the HG movies. "
"The Hanging Tree I love the hanging tree more than the others because it has that creepy 
feel like if you don't go to the hanging tree something very bad is going 
to happen. It makes me me get goosebumps every time I hear it. "
"Amazing For the people saying she should stick to acting you're wrong. She sounded 
very good seeing as it wasn't auto tuned or anything. The film was 
fantastic and I'm a huge fan over the Hunger games! Five stars all 
around!!! "
"Its OK but not worth the money J Law should just stick to acting. This wasn't really a good song and J 
Law doesn't really sing all that good. Like I said she should just stick to 
acting. Try Hanging tree Rebel Remix. Its much better. "
"The hanging tree Number 8, incoming bombers is like a star-wars-type song. OMG I WANNA SING 
THE HANGING TREE AT SCHOOL ITS SO GOOD "
"HOLY CRAP. Best song ever! The sound quality is just... OMG! The song is beautiful 
and morbid at the same time. I'm only 10 years old and I love it. I watch 
it at least once a day on YouTube. 3 words. Like a boss. :3 "
"I hate this... So i am beyond furious with this song... I absolutely love it but i was 
able to listen to it for 3 days on youtube and now i cannot. I hate that 
now we have to pay in order to listen to music. "
"The hanging tree Are you, are you coming to the tree? Where I told you to run so we'd both 
be free. Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be. If we met 
at midnight in the hanging tree. LOVE IT! "
"Holy craaapp! Best song EVER I'm totally in love with the hanging tree. When I saw the very first 
showing of mocking jay the night before it came out, I drove straight home 
and downloaded this song! "
"Amazing Score and Eventful Movie! So many dramatic things happened in the movie! It was so good! The score 
is also mysterious and there is so much tension. Both the score and the 
movie are grim but entertaining! Jen's Voice is amazing in The Hanging 
Tree! Five Stars for everything!!!!! "
"Love the movie I hate when Katniss found peater like that and when he got mad at her. I 
think he didnt mean to do that, he was just mad at her bc he got beaten 
from the state. "
"Won't play The first song I downloaded works but this one says error and won't play 
I'd buy more music if this one worked.. I'm really disappointed cause I 
love this song if it gets fixed I will definitely change my rating 
(probably to five stars) "
"Hunger Game Trilogy As a huge fan of the hunger game Trilogy, I really love this album because 
the music does a really good job of capturing what happens and adds clímax 
to the whole movie/book "
"The Hanging Chestnut Tree So I just realized that Suzanne Collins took yet another ""inspiration"" 
from another great dystopian work of art and just added her own twist. In 
Nineteen Eighty-Four, there's a song that plays that goes: under the 
spreading chestnut tree/I sold you and you sold me/there lie they, and here 
lie we/under the spreading chestnut tree. Which in turn is Orwell's take of 
a poem by Harry Wadsworth Longfellow. Why did she have to precisely use a 
tree song as motiff in her book? "
"Amazing This is a great album that goes along with the movie so well. The only 
thing is I would not recemend it for kids under the age of eight because of 
some of the songs "
"Hunger games is amazing Hanging tree is the best but the movie is sad when peeta ( that's how you 
spell his name) attacks Katniss because the capital drugged him so he would 
lose it and want to kill her "
"FANTABULOUS Dis was amazing. I hate how Jennifer Lawrence said she didn't sing well. 
She sounds amazing and hanging tree was such an inspiration in the 
districts. I can't get it out of my head. "
"Hmmmm... interesting..... The Hanging Tree sounds different than the one done by Sam Cushion. I was 
kind of expecting the tune of the one by Sam Cushion but I don't really 
care. :) "
"Hunger Games Album for part 1 Downloaded Hanging Tree (my new ringtone) absoluetly loved the movie and 
with the sound track, even better "
"Mocking Jay sound track Omg I loved this movie, can't wait to get it on DVD, I would totally 
recommend this sound track to anyone and the movie to anyone. It was 
amazing "
The Hunger Games Mockin My favorite song out of this album is hanging tree. 
I loved the movie The hanging tree is my favorite one 
"The hanging tree There's something about the song that is so good it gets stuck in your 
head! This whole album is great and I'm happy to say I love it! "
"I love this so much!!! Are you are you singing these songs too? There stuck in my head. Theres 
nothing i can do! "
"Great album One of the best motion picture albums I've heard in a long while. Great 
scores, great rhythms, great movie in general if you haven't see it or 
bought the cd please do you self a favor and do both. Will not regret it "
"Omg! Hanging tree is the best song! Omg! Buy hanging tree. Jennifer was all worried about being a horrible 
singer and I have no idea what she is talking about!!! She is amazing!!!!! 
I sing this song like all day! Its my favorite scene in the movie!!!! Such 
an amazing song! "
"The hanging tree is better here I listen to other but this one is best I watched hunger games mocking jay 
part 1 and I love the song I wish it was free though also for Christmas.Its 
great. "
hunger games mocking jay movie songs LOVE it so much 
"The hanging tree I'd my favorite song like are you? Are you? The movie is awesome but I got 
really mad when my friend said prim and finnick die in pt 2 but I hope not "
"I absolutely am infatuated with the hunger games and couldn't live without 
it. This soundtrack just helps with my addiction to it until the next one 
comes out. "
Mocking jay This is the best song ever 
"Brilliant Clap yourself on the back all of you. Fine work. The music is brilliant 
and the movie is great to much better than the book and it's only part 1 "
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Very great album. To like it more, you should watch the film. "
"The Hanging Tree I love the song. It's The Hunger Games version of Do You Hear The People 
Sing. "
"The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part I- The Hanging Tree Such a great song! Jennifer Lawrence's voice makes it so chilling, which 
is what exactly the way it is suppose to be! "
"OMG My favorite song from Mocking Jay is and always will be The Hanging Tree. 
That song is so sad but so beautiful! Amazing! "
"Good music but This album gives away the movie if you pay at tension and it's not bad but 
I'm just saying. "
"Great film, decent album. The overall narrative of this experiment is brilliant unfortunately the 
ambition causes the album to lack the same hard hitting packed style that 
Childish Gambino has always had going for him. "
"Truly enjoyable Amazing album, not just a album but a full masterpiece of art. Including 
screenplay, linking video clips and little hints and connections 
intertwined into everything Donald Glover does. An amazing experience. "
"Album of the Year for me. This is on par with camp and in parts, even better. Highlights are crawl, 
3005, life: the biggest troll, and the party "
"Crazy! To my embarrassment I had never heard of this fellow and after hearing 
this album I wish had a lot sooner! Next level. "
"Truly a creative masterpiece I hate hip hop.. But this is actually an incredible album... Reminds me of 
Pink Floyd. "
"First of its kind. Hopefully not the last. Probably would have given the album a 3.5/4 if not for reading the 
accompanying screen play. Hope they make a movie for it. "
"Its okay I think all of his songs should be more like 'V. 3005' or 'The worst guys' 
they have a brighter mood and his voice goes well with the genre of the 
song, the other songs are still good but that is just my personal opinion 
but this guy never fails to keep giving quality songs "
OMG!! this is so amazing! I have a new music graze now hip-hop and rap! now one of my fav artisits 
"Are you eating though? This album goes ham, but not like average noughties rap its deeper than 
you think "
"My favourite album ever. Not a single bad song with some great highlights like Worldstar and 
Telegraph Avenue. "
"Album of the year! So creative, nothing remotely like it "
"fresh So different to what I was expecting, brilliant album. Looking forward to 
his new stuff "
First times Ok tunes 
Meh Weak rap on a decent beat 
Childish Gambino Listen to this. 
"Fantastic ITunes did this as there free song and absolutely love it! Great that 
android market have done the same "
"Good album. Just nothing that stood out to me. Hard to beat an album as good as camp 
though. "
M That's the dude from community! 
"Jesus. The artist, reborn "
That Bino the releast. 
The album is below his average. But still good 
"This album, is so good I fully rate this "
I love gambino But he needs to do a song with Iggy Azalea! 
3005 is good But dont like the rest 
Amazing rapper <3 Highlight deffo 3005 
Loved It CG is the bomb 
Good album Herd on radio had to get it 
Fuck yeahh 
Underground music 
Because of the internet 
Sweatpants is the only good song 
These songs are life 
:) Yess 
Perfect Must buy 
Sweet It was great 
Amazing Love. 
gambinooooo 
Good Epic 
Amazing Brilliant 
Lyrical genius 
"Pretty Good Album As far as pop albums go, I've heard much worse than Echosmith's ""Talking 
Dreams."" While I wouldn't go far enough to call each song life changing, 
there is enough pop goodness here to make for an interesting listen. I 
didn't regret my purchase of this album. In fact, I'm listening to it right 
now, almost a month after I bought it. That says a lot. "
"Fantastic album across the board This band's debut album embodies the feelings of those who have been left 
out or are in a rough patch. Wishing they could be part of society that 
everyone knows and likes and not be shunned upon for being themselves. 
Talking Dreams is an album that appeals to a different alternative crowd, 
one that many can relate to. This album is platinum worthy not just because 
I like it, but because it serves a good purpose, with a positive message. 
Take a listen, and really listen. You won't be disappointed. "
"Really? I'm a big fan of Paramore and Metric, and this just seems like they're 
trying to be the next in a string of successful and talented groups. News 
flash; no one likes a one trick puppy. I don't mean to be harsh, but this 
band just seems like a bad copy of Metric. "
"Great Alternative! I tend to jump on stuff further off from mainstream, and Echosmith 
certainly caters to that desire. I twisted my ankle something awful today 
and finding this album for .99 while I was laid up was a great surprise. 
Every song is cheerful and enjoyable, I think March Into the Sun is my 
favorite. ❤❤❤❤ Thanks for something different from the rest! "
"Cool kids I love the song the cool kids. It kinda makes sense the cool kids do fit 
in and I think we all fit in some were not be cool. If u r hating on this 
song then u have no taste in music "
"Very good indie Really good....I mean yea some of it seems repetitive but its a good album 
and very catchy. I only knew cool kids then I looked them up and they 
remind of me of paramore whom I like a lot, she has a really good voice and 
I hope they do good with whatever they come out with next "
"Cool Kids This is my #1 song becuz me and My friend were listen to this song good 
members and my friend is a girl she is so kul. And it tells me u dnt have 
to be a cool kid and be yourself not to be sumone u arent jus yurself!! "
"Refreshing and Well done! This is a great album and very impressive considering it was recorded by 
mostly teenagers. The songs are well written and recorded. Reminds me at 
times of Taylor Swift. Great pop music. I paid $7.99 in iTunes and am happy 
to support good hard working musicians as I've been in their shoes. I'm 
sure that the nay-sayers all base their ""expert"" opinion on the Cool Kids 
song but even that song is interesting and fun. Echosmith has already 
accomplished more than these negative nancies ever will. Looking forward to 
more great music from this young group! "
"Lisyen For the commenter who said the sound is boring, try something new... 
Listen to the words. These guys could be the modern day Partridge family 
and I say that with all respect and gladness. "
"Ugh God this is so boring! We need new exciting rock n roll not whatever this 
is! The sound is so bland and overdone! "
"Best album I've ever heard Never in my life have I heard so many songs in one album that I enjoyed. 
Each song has a different feel and they don't sound the same. The tune is 
amazing in all of the songs and I believe that this album is 
groundbreaking. I especially love the song ""Tell Her You Love Her"". Props. "
"You Homos HOW CAN YALL JUST COME AND TOP KING KENDRICK LIKE THAT. PEOPLE BOUGHT YOUR 
ALBUM JUST TO LISTEN TO THAT ONE SINGLE. WHY YOUR ALBUM MAKE ME WANNA GO 
INTO A DEPRESSION "
"good sound I bought the deluxe version of this album but i see it's no longer 
available for sale this is a good band. pretty pop rock music. reminds me 
of the 80s. "
"? Kudo's for the whole family group thing. But be like one of the cool kids 
and..... Not put out another album:) pretty please! "
"Found echosmith at warped tour pnc bank art center 2012 I got their mixtape/lp for free just for signing up for their emailing 
list at warped tour. Nobody even knew they existed at the time. A lot of 
bands were there that day so I didn't get a chance to see them live (5 
different stages with 5 different schedules. Either way I gave the cd a 
listen a couple days later and was immediately attracted to the song ""cool 
kids"". Heard them on the radio about a year later and was like ""I know that 
song"". Couldn't wait to tell everybody I knew and the rest is history! :) "
"One of my favorite bands. Great sound and style. I don't get some of the comments people put. ""They 
need to find their own sound/ style?"" I know one of their pieces whenever 
it comes on because they have a distinct sound different from other groups. 
And the one about Cool Kids encouraging people to fit in, they clearly 
didn't listen too closely, because the song is about exactly the opposite. 
""They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going. In the 
fast lane, living life without knowing."" Brilliant, subtle song. "
"This Album Grew On Me I loved cool kids so i started listening more and now i can't stop. I love 
this album. "
"This is my song cool kid's When I'm sad or jest had a hard day i hard this song and it makes my heart 
pump by the second's go by this song.This song is world's best song. "
"Accual Cool kids!! It's sad when there are poeple out there that can't appreciate GOOD 
hearted music then take the time to tear it apart... great album echosmith "
"Really sucks Holy crap bad music keeps coming n idiots keep buying it. Really ud have 
to have severe head trauma to enjoy this boring music. Really it's the 
worst "
"Excellent debut Reminds me of lots of bands from the 80's & 90's who managed to mix some 
pop with some great melodies and simple guitar riffs and rhythms and a 
little melancholy here and there. It's very evocative, in a good way. "
"Reminds me of Paramore I like the sound. Reminds me a lot of Paramore before they broke up. Keep 
up the good work. "
"No offense. I admire what they're doing at this age and i think they have potential, 
but they sound like every other band in this genre. They need to find their 
own sound. "
"positive viiibes!! this album finds comfort in the happy times rather than in darkness like 
others. Quite interesting. her voice reminds me of 2010 taylor swift as 
well!! they have room to grow, but gr8 debut album!! "
"Hate cool kidSsssss THIS SONG IS ALL THEY PLAY ON THE RADIO THAT SONG SUCKS ITS NOT GOOD AT 
ALLLLLLLL "
Music is perfect! But Why I can't listen it in my country??? It's terrible! 
"Inspiring"" I really love all their songs, their songs are so beautifully written, I 
love echosmith you can really relate to where they are coming from♥ "
He he ok if u say so Just saying cool = constipated over raded out sided loser 
"ASDFGHJKL omg new fave band! I absolutely LOVE ""Tell Her You Love Her"" and ""Bright"". 
It's not supposed to be rock music; it's just really chill and pretty indie 
music. And I love it ♥ "
"I read that the female singer here has been compared to Ellie Goulding. I 
don't think she sounds like her at all. I would compare her to Hayley 
Williams from Paramore. "
"Great Album I love how Google Play is offering entire albums for $0.99. This album is 
really good and for $0.99 you can't go wrong!! :) "
"So proud I have been with them since before Cool Kids made a HUGE success and I 
just want to say they're completely worth it to follow and to buy the album 
from. Will always be a fan of Echosmith!! "
Bored Come on Google. Play. Golf. Is more. Exciting. On TV 
"Amazing Band What makes this band amazing, among many other things, is how young they 
all are. Their drummer is 15 or 16 and main singer around 20. This is 
amazing talent for being so young, "
"""Cool Kids"" is pointless The song just doesn't appeal to me, there is nothing interesting about it, 
and because of that turn off, I will not buy your album. "
"Best new band I have the song cool kids stuck in my head. The rest of the album is good 
as well. I would definitely recommend. "
"Amazing!!!! This song should always be 5 star rated .I'm one of those kids in school 
that always gets teased and hurt alot so this song always lifts me up when 
I feel that way. "
"It's OK I like it,if i had just listened to the reviews i wouldn't have gotten 
it,but it's not bad. "
"Something fresh Cool sound - some deep thoughts but not overdoing it. It feels fresh and 
new - yet somehow familiar. They're shockingly young... but they know their 
music "
"New favorite band Can't remember the last time I bought a whole album trusting I was gonna a 
love the songs I ha nt heard, and wasn't disappointed! "
"Jeri Inks Larson I don't see a looser in the bunch. this combination is bridging a 
generation gap in the slickest way possible. Tony is a renown entertainer 
and has been for decades; Lady G is ruling the world now and introduced a 
stage presence that mirrors a musical production with all of her shows and 
the two together and enjoying it is just magical. I can't wait to hear the 
whole thing as it will be history in the making and hold so much deeper a 
meaning than just good music. Love them both and wish them big success! 
gramma gg "
"I smell Grammy Album of the Year and new-found respect! After hearing the first two preorder songs on iTunes/YouTube (Anything 
Goes & I Can't Give You), I can honestly say that this album is going to 
gain her a newfound respect as an artist! I've always respected her as the 
most freely creative pop star of mainstream pop today, she is clearly more 
creative, less manufacturerd and more different than most female pop stars 
today. This new jazz direction sounds raw, beautiful & musical! It's good 
to see a pop star push the 'venture-into different-genres' boundary! "
"A beautiful combination! So lovely to have a popular artist not afraid to put herself 'out of her 
element' and change things up. Such a lovely and light collection of songs 
- perfect for people sick of all the crap music nowadays! I couldn't be 
happier or prouder to be a Gaga fan. ^____^ "
"This Makes Up For Everything Never been a fan of Lady Gaga's previous work. This album? Absolutely 
phenomenal. Gaga has an amazing jazz voice. Had she been born half a 
century back, she'd have been one of the greats; no doubt in my mind. Great 
album, completely recommended. "
"Wow. You know, Lady Gaga had planted this image in my mind that she was just an 
artist who made music for the money, but this whole album changed my 
perspective. I can feel her soul through this music, this album, and I can 
without a doubt say that she has won my heart by giving me and her music 
what other ""artists"" of this generation lack, and that's soul. "
"Incredible and Singular For the all bad critics about lady gaga choices , I think cheek to cheek 
is a brilliant idea to show the next generations what the beautiful and 
intrinsic jazz means. Thanks so much Tony Bennet and Lady Gaga for give 
back the jazz to us and shake again! "
"Was expecting trash, instead, I got class! Introducing classy jazz music to our young generation! I love track #1 & 
#4, BUT.... theyre all awesome! Gaga and Tony sound GREAT together! Coming 
from a 13 yr old, I love it! "
"Amazing Just bought cheek to cheek deluxe album. I'm gonna listen to it all night. 
I been a little monster since 2009. I always knew you could sing! By the 
way, I smell Grammy's! #pawsup "
"Amazeballs It's nothing like any other artist have done or accomplished. 
Tony+Gaga=Art Both their voices compliment each other's. Never a fan of 
jazz until I heard Lady Is A Tramp can't wait for it to be released. Most 
def buying it "
"It Don't Mean a Thing If it ain't got that swing! This album is absolute GOLD. All the remakes 
formed beautifully with the touch of Lady Gaga. I also find I like her 
voice much better in this genre. Tony Bennett forever. ♥ "
"Gaga at her best Despite this album not being her ""ussual"" gaga has never sounded better. 
Her voice is beyond beautiful in this album and Tony's Voice compliments it 
quite well. Well done Gaga. This album wont sell as much as her others 
simply because it is jazz based... BUT it will finally prove that she will 
be ageless and her voice will carry through the decades. This album can be 
summed up as PURE. RAW. TALENT. "
"Amazing Who though she could take a 1933's song and put it as beautiful as it is. 
Lush life is one of my favorite song of the album. It's a breathtaking 
masterpiece from the one and only Gaga. Thanks so much for bringing to us 
such power and beauty into our lives. I recommend this album to anyone who 
ever doubt the voice of this great Woman and of course to all the fans of 
classic jazz music and the fans of Gaga ou Bennet. "
"Perfect but too soon. I thing Lady Gaga and Tony go Really great with each other. This album 
deserved it's #1 place. But I don't like the fact that it's Lady gagas 5th 
album in 7 years. And came way too soon after Artpop (less than a year). I 
feel like she's moving a bit too fast. I love the theme and style of the 
album but just settle a bit "
"Awesome I freaking adore you Mother Monster. Michael Jackson since I was a baby 
and then Lady Gaga since my confusing, she making it then an empowering, 
adolescence. Both of them forever for me. <3 can't wait for this tour :)))) "
"Anyone who needs a reminder that Gaga is more than pageantry will get a 
refresher with this album. She and Tony sound amazing together and breath 
life back into songs that have slipped from mainstream consciousness. Lady 
Gaga has an amazing and versatile voice and I think this album will appeal 
to Little Monsters as we as non-Little Monsters alike. "
"I love Gaga!! But this album photo is ugly. Tony is a rapist looker. And gaga looks 
funny. "
"Great intro to jazz for this young generation Having Lady Gaga on this album with the amazing Tony Bennett bridges the 
generational gap in an brilliant way. She was phenomenal on his Duets 2 
album, and so this collection doesn't surprise me. Great intro to jazz 
standards. "
Jazz? Will she do anything to make money. How unoriginal !!! 
"Wow Gaga is a lady on this album and Tony a gentleman as always. Vocals are 
100% amazing. Remember the songs were recored live with no autotune.So far 
,this album gets 5 stars out of five. Great job! Jazz 4 ever. "
"Love It Been Looking Forward To This Album Since Lady is A Tramp! Lady Gaga slays 
The Jazz Genre, Expecting Grammy's soon... "
"Love this album is one of the most best jazz albums I ever heard especially 
with Lady Gaga you can actually hear her jazz voice in the album and she 
sounds very unique. also I have never heard Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga used 
their voice together in one album and they both sound very amazing and it's 
such a beautiful album, what I love about this album is that you can use it 
with all through the year, it's good for Valentines Day, Christmas, Easter, 
Thanksgiving, and even parties and it's such a lovely album "
"I think this album is the best this year. Lady Gaga is amazing on this and blends vocally so well with Tony Bennett 
I love her solos too vocals sound so pure and great! "
"Fresh and Classic This is the album I've been waiting for! Ever since I heard these two belt 
out ""Lady Is A Tramp,"" I've been dying to hear a full album featuring these 
two powerful, relaxing, and unique voices. It's sure to surprise and win 
over many who do not call themselves ""Little Monsters."" Finally an album 
that will reach younger parts of societies ears and maybe, just maybe, 
culture them. I hope this album brings you as much joy as it does me! "
"Lady Gaga....I would love to see her perform in a beautiful gown with her hair 
long and straight (and her natural color) and No crazy makeup to take away 
from her natural looks, & Tony as nice as he always looks.... and do a 
wonderful performance...that would be something. "
"pure magic! they sound amazing! & lady gaga blows my mind! what a great thing these 
two created. ❤❤ "
"Two legends ♡ Lady Gaga has a versatile voice, it fits in all genres she wants to sing. 
And this jazz album with Tony Benett it's something I can't wait to hear. "
"Perfeito Um album que mostra toda a versatilidade musical de Lady Gaga e o controle 
quase monodico de Mr.Benett. Cheek to Cheek ja é considerado um clássico 
poucos dias após seu lançamento e, certamente será um daqueles que sempre 
estará na boca de todos por muito tempo. "
"I love that this album finally came out! I have been hoping for a jazz 
album of Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett ever since they did ""Lady is a Tramp."" 
The songs on the album are great, and they didn't disappoint me at all. "
"This Album Is Everything You Need In Life I listened the first time and I fell in love with this it's so relaxing 
and smooth and soft good music going to my ears and I'm enjoying every 
crumb of this amazing duet of Tony and GAGA "
"Cheek to Cheek Vocals are amazing. Not a fan of jazz, but have new found respect for it 
after hearing some songs off the album. An instant classic! "
"WHERE'S BANG BANG?! From all the songs I've heard so far I just know this album's going to be 
amazing but how come on iTunes you get an extra song (Bang Bang), which I 
know is a song that Gaga will ace, so I'd really like it if that was added, 
thanks! "
Awful She failed in pop now she failed in jazz. She's just a failure in life. 
"Gaga & Bennett.. Are music Genius'. These two are a force to be reckoned with. Gaga's 
vocals definitely shine on this record and Bennett is just amazing. Great 
album for anyone who enjoys Gaga! "
"Gorgeous! I'm a jazz singer and Cheek to Cheek is on my own album. This 
Tony/Gaga version is stunning along with the rest of this album. He is a 
legend but I truly had no idea she could sing like this! "
"Sublime 2 Grandes artistas se unen y crean una verdadera joya. Lady Gaga es la 
artista actual más completa. "
"STUNNING I loooove this album so much!! Gaga...?!!!! Wowed me!! Completely wowed me 
with her amazing vocals.And Tony, Man his sound is still so sexy and raw 
and....I never thought I'd like this..But I am won over.Gives me chills!! I 
love cheek to cheek.Thrilled!!!! "
"Wow I wasn't expecting lady gaga I've gotta say she looks great out of her 
crazy clothes and makeup "
"Simply Amazing I am not big on jazz, but this album, it has changed my perspective on 
this genre, and this wasn't about her wanting to make money, she has 
admitted that she has always loved jazz and she had been trained in jazz 
since she was little "
"Best album ever Recently I'm big fan of jazz, and I've been Little Monster for a long time 
and I think that this album is the best, pure perfection, absolutely 
gorgeous! Paws up Lady Gaga! "
Crap More rubbish music from a reductive idiot. 
"Amazing Foo's as expected, but nothing out of the ordinary. The Foo's rock out with this one too. So kudos to them for this. Sounds 
great, the songs really have the classic Foo Fighters sound, it's amazing 
what these guys can do. But overall I don't think there's anything 
hit-worthy I could put my finger on...and to be fair after listening to the 
whole album I couldn't say I remember one particular song that stood out. 
Or I don't know, maybe ""Outside"". So the sound, the music is great, but 
overall just the regular Foo Fighters without anything really standing out. "
"Awesome! First of all, why did you people pre-order for? Did you think they would 
run out of downloads lmao! wow. Anyway, this album rocks! Love the 
integration of rick nielsen, gary clark jr, zack brown etc guest starring 
on various tracks. They represented the numerous cities they traveled to 
record in well. Thats what this is all about, a love letter to the great 
music scenes of America. Buy it. "
"Love it! I've been watching Sonic Highways on HBO and every time they played a 
song, I kept wanting to hear more. Decided to look it up to find this album 
and I cannot get enough of it. Foo Fighters are amazing and I'm lucky to 
have seen them live. They never ever disappoint. <33333 :) "
"Foo Fighters culture shock This took a few listens to get into, but I am hooked now. After watching 
the HBO documentary, you know how much the Foo FIghters love music. They do 
take on a slightly new sound from song to song, but they still stay true to 
""their"" sound in the end. "
"Where is my download??? I've heard the first three songs, and they're brilliant and I know the 
rest will be also. But Google please dont turn me away from buying music 
from you... I Pre-ordered the album in October, you took money from me on 
9th November, how hard is it to give me access to it on the 11th November 
especially as the date listed under the title says 10th November. I'll give 
it 5 stars cause it's the Foo Fighters and they deserve nothing less. But 
this will be the last time I Pre-order any album from you. "
"Foo Fighters never disappoint They are as good as they ever have been. Saw them at Voodoo Fest in New 
Orleans days before this album was released and they teased us with one 
song. If you love them, learn the story behind the making of this album! "
"This is amazing! I can't even choose a favorite song... I am very happy with how they have 
evolved. The songs on here are longer, so I believe that is why there are 
eight. I think it is ridiculous not to at least try to listen to this just 
because there are only eight songs. "
"Great Album Maybe not be an instant like for people who loved Wasting Light due to 
only half the record being all out hard rock, but this album is amazing 
because the other half brings back the 90s foo fighters with soft melody 
rock too. This album reaches the quality of both The Color and the Shape 
and Wasting Light which I consider the two best stand out albums by them 
even though I own and love all their albums. "
"Does Not Dissapoint!! Leave it to the Foo Fighters, to come out with an album so high in quality 
after all the years they've been together. They haven't lost it, and I 
highly doubt they ever will. Great album, fantastic band. "
"Another fantastic foos album Great album. Sometimes has trouble flowing together and seems shorter than 
most ff albums, but that could be me. Highlights: Something From Nothing, 
Feast and the Famine, and I Am A River "
"... Wasting light didn't impress me, and I hate to say it but this one is even 
worse. Don't understand how they went from echoes to these last two. 
Congregation's chorus has a cool chord progression, and that's about it... "
"Pure class again How the foo's keep delivering more and better just defies belief. Dave 
didn't just pop in the studio and presto another album of more the same, 
its a masterpiece of musical depth inspired from his road trip for the 
American Rock ... "
"Ton of respect for Dave G. His picture should be in the dictionary next to the word Rock! The Foos 
are a great band just like his others (nirvana, probot, them crooked 
vultures). And he never mixes the music, every band is original. This album 
is great, it just keeps growing on me. Fun idea of writting and recording a 
new song in every city. Rock on Dave, Taylor, Pat, Chris, and Nate. "
"Am I too old? Never knew much about the talented David Grohl until I saw the BBC Sound 
City TV documentary and read his autobiography 'This Is A Call' . Now wish 
I look listened to my nearly 40 year old son's Nirvana vinyl / CDs . Love 
the ""Sonic Highways"" TV series at present showing on BBC TV and BBC i 
player. Educating so many about USA roots. Am I too old to buy this at 61? "
"It's Official.... The Foo Fighters have never put out a bad album! I really love the 
structure of this album. 8 great songs and no fluff or bonus tracks. Just 
like bands used to do back in the day. Great job guys! "
"Disappointed I've been a Foo Fighters fan from the beginning and believe they are 
great. But I was disappointed with Sonic Highway because of the lack of 
material. 8 songs. And out of those there are 4 worth. listening to - 
Feast/Famine, Congregation, Outside, In The Clear. The others are rehashed 
of old Foo, or songs made by canabalizing Dio and/or Lynyrd Skynyrd. 
Something to put out before Christmas for the marketing executives I guess. "
"Another great one My dad introduced me to the foo fighters at about age ten with one by one 
and I can't get enough, love the new album and I'm gonna go see them live 
asap. "
"Sonic highways I love the foo fighters . But this new cd is horrible. Daves worst lyrics 
ever. I have ever foo cd and been to like 6 concerts. I can't support this. 
Please make a new crooked vultures cd and take some time off. Foo is much 
better then this. "
"I have been watching ""Sonic Highways"" on HBO The three episodes so far have been amazing as well as the songs. If you 
like the Foo Fighters music anyway, watch Sonic Highways and you will fall 
in love. Cant wait for the release! "
"Great Rock and Roll The Foo Fighters are nothing if not consistent. They do straight up Rock 
and they do it well. And Sonic Highways is no exception. It doesn't sound 
like there is any standout no.1 hits. But as a total album it is pretty 
darn good. Not perfect, but good. "
"A return to roots I have loved all the foo fighters work but the early albums through 
""nothing left to lose"" were better than the following ones. ""Sonic 
Highways"" feels like it fits in with those early albums perfectly combining 
a perfect mix of hard rock and softer songs. It is gritty, honest and 
beautiful and a new favorite! "
"Yassss ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Loved every second of it. Something from nothing is 
gonna be a hit, that song live is great. I really love all the songs so 
much. I think they did really good on this album. Personally enjoy 'the 
feast and the famine' most "
