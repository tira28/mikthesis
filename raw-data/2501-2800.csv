"Ugh It's terrible. Just, I expected better man. Super let down. "
"This is NOT scam and the album is AWESOME For those worrying, just proceed with your Paypal account or a gift card. 
This man's heartwarming voice makes this album one of the best Christmas 
albums. "
"It is free,not a scam I guess those who get a pop up for card info must be logged out of their 
google account or their google account does not have card info, I wish I 
could post a screenshot of my receipt that says I paid $0.00. A pop up with 
a buy button showed up and it didn't ask me for card info. "
"It is so free!! I have free movies free books free songs free games. And I don't even have 
a credit card!!! Google play is not a scam. If it says its free you get it 
free. If it says it costs...then you pay. Simple as that.... "
"Thank you! I was just talking about having this album for Christmas just this morning 
with my best friend. Thank you so much you really just made my Christmas "
"This man produces pure gold! My family and me love to listen to Michael Buble all year round, but I 
have to say that listening to him sing all of those great Christmas songs 
has become a tradition in our home. I will go as far as saying that our 
Christmas time hasn't begun until we are enjoying his Christmas music! 
Thank you Michael, and Merry Christmas to you and your family. "
"He makes every classical song sound 100% better just like the singers who 
originally created those classical songs did. "
"IT IS, FREE It's good Christmas music for FREE! FYI you don't need to be a ""member"" 
like others say, it's FREE for everyone, and it's just like every other 
free app they offer. FREE. "
"Love His Voice! This is a great album and I'm so glad it's free! It's amazing!! Great 
music to help you get into the christmas spirit! (NOTE: To everyone saying 
it's a scam, it's not a scam! As long as you have had a gift card on your 
account it will let you get it! It's Completely free!!) "
"Good Christmas Album This is a great FREE Christmas Album. Some people are upset about having 
to give credit card info. Understandable, but you have to do that to 
purchase anything on the play store. "
"Yes free I buy a $10 Google play gift card...loaded it and when I buy free games, 
music, books no credit card needed. Piece of cake! And thx for the free 
music. Merry Christmas! "
"It's good but... I like this album for the most part and I'm glad I got it for free but 
when I listened to Ave Maria, I cringed. Idk why artists tackle language 
songs without learning how to pronounce the words in those songs. Sheesh! "
"Wow Nice timing from Google who picked it out for me, and such a great price. 
Besides that, great sound from him and his friends! "
"In all fairness: Just like iTunes, a credit card is required to establish an account. I 
have not had any problems with Google Play (or iTunes for that matter) 
regarding security or unapproved billing. Free really is free! Build your 
library and enjoy!! It's worth it. Michael is a real crooner and I enjoy 
his fascinating rework on old tunes. Very surprised to see this >entire< 
album for free. Thanks! "
"Yes it's free. you people are retarded. This is a decent album. it's free so 5 stars. and it really is free. yes 
you need credit card info but so many things need it. same as the apple 
store. They only need that info to link the purchase to an account. I've 
downloaded TONS of free stuff the Google Play store offers. I got the lord 
of the rings movie in HD FREE. and some other great movies and music. A 
whole free Lorde album. Google play has saved me plenty of money. so please 
stop giving a free item 1 star and complaining about credit card info. it 
isn't a scam. It's funny that people like you can even use a computer. "
"Thank you Google Why can't people just be thankful for an entire FREE album. ""OMG GOOGLE'S 
STEALIN MAH INFOS!!1!1"" You're signed into an android device with your 
gmail so they already get all kinds of info from you. Get over 
yourselves... "
Free but blah I prefer original Christmas music not this new remix 
"Bad This guy cannot sing...it wants to be la sinatra, but his voice is really 
bad...bad free album google "
"Thank you for the free music! What a great list to play today. It really is free. Your card on file 
won't be charged. "
"I love these free albums While every one is stressing about credit card info I'm listen to some 
Christmas classics for $0.00 "
"I love Journey and think the lead singer has the most incredible voice, too 
bad he keeps retiring. I buy all their stuff and highly recommend them. "
"journey Just a handful of amazing mellow hits. Look further into the Journey 
catalogue for even better songs and more up to date stuff. Been to see them 
live twice, their music is mind blowing. I would recommend live cd 
Captured. "
"My Journey is complete Im only 26 and grew up listening to my aunts blast a journey song on radio 
and albums and ive been hooked ever since. I loooobr Steve Perry and Neal 
Schon's guitar lix! "
"Great album and band Steve Perry has one of the greatest voices of all time. Who's crying now 
is my favorite song but I like the whole album. "
"Its classic rock now. Saw Journey in '79 while stationed in TX serving in USAF. Don't know what 
was hotter, band or the babe's in the audience. Steve Perry WAS Journey. "
"I am only 13 and l love every song!!! I am tired of hearing the same songs 
over and over again on the radio. It is time they put on some 80s. "
"Dear journey who was the new kid in the band he sounds just like original 
singer in the van I am surprised he sounds very good excellent job well 
done I said from the Philippines no one can do Lykke til Sun just like him 
duck vs twin brother to know good job well done very good idea I think him 
and Steve could do a duet together in your neck bad it will be nice does 
she do a duet together who's down the best oh by the way they both still 
have to say about something him and Steve should do a duet it will be "
"I would recommend The Essential Journey over this CD, but combine this 
Greatest hits with Greatest Hits 2 and you have a wonderful selection of 
the songs that made Journey so popular. This is a group that is associated 
with the 80's, but their success really began in the 70's. While not as 
popular today as they were in the 80's, Journey has been recording original 
music and touring for 40 years. The years during Steve Perry's membership 
in Journey were the most successful for the band in no small part due to 
the vocal and lyrical abilities of Steve Perry that are represented on this 
CD. The band has never regained that level of popularity as they do not 
seem to understand that it is not just the tone of voice or range that 
Steve Perry brought to the band, but the inflections and understanding of 
where a singers voice fits into the music. A subtle motown influence in 
Steve Perry and the hard rock, latin and fusion roots of Neal Schon created 
a sound that had more substance than the typical hair band contemporaries 
of those days. "
"Journey is the absolute best!!!! I loved journey ever since I heard who's crying now for the first time. 
Steve Perry makes this band the best. It really is such a shame that he 
left the band after trial by fire. But if he ever comes back, I'll be the 
first one in line to buy a ticket! Love you Steve Perry! "
"Yes! I may only be 18 but I still know good music when I hear it. That dubstep 
crap doesn't even compare to Journey's smooth feel and Steve Perry's spine 
tingling tenor. Who's in charge of inventing that time machine? I call dibs 
on the first trip; 1980's here I come! "
"I love journey always have Album is great,songs are awesome. Loved Journey since I was a kid. "
"Awesome album I love old school music. Journey is some of the .BEST from back In my day. 
Old school rockk is the greatest rock alive!!!! "
"The first time I heard don't stop believing was a minor key version on 
youtube and I loved it! "
"GHV2 Be advised there is a companion piece to this album Greatest Hits Volume 2 
and they are both sold together as one unit on CD. "
"BE LIVING IN GOD! DON'T EVER STOP BELIEVING IN GOD THE FATHER,GOD THE SON, AND GOD THE HOLY 
SPIRIT! "
"Superb best of album Every song is superb, going to see them again in May cannot wait... "
"I love this goup steve perry ment my heart he can sang to me all night long 
he is so fine I wish that he did not leave the group "
"Journey I loved Journey in High School, especially Open Arms. I believe they were 
overlooked for some reason, but They will always be the best to me!! "
"Lost my money Payed $50 for several song and have not got any music but lost my money 
you thieving dogs "
"I love every song Steve Perry Journey has ever recorded and especially when 
they performed live. "
"Journey very good sound Very good music,still sounds great,love this old school music,nothing else 
like it "
"The best ! I am 35 now and ever since I can remember Journey has been playing in the 
background in my familys house. Steve Perrys voice is Amazing! And the 
whole group is just so talented . The Don't stop beliving documentary on 
netflix is great too . I would love to see Steve Perry with the group again 
and in concert . "
"Greatest Hits Fan for 25 years,this album.... I lv,luvv,lurrrrrve it :o)x "
"This sucks just use youtube I bout this so I don't need data but you do 
total waste of money "
"I love Journey, and yes the new singer is good, but he's not Steve Perry Journey is one of the best groups there ever was! "
"The Best Really, it doesn't get any better than this! The Voice is incomparable.. "
"Amazing Easily one of the best collections out there; if you don't have Journey 
you're really missing out! "
"Don't stop believing Awesome, that's all I can say. "
Journey(Steve Perry) Ever and anything he sings. Sooo.. sexy 
Im a 80's teen love this music makes me wish I was back there. 
"Journey Burnt out...I thought they died...well, I grew up with them all through my 
teens... The 70's!!! ZEPPELIN IS ROCK'S GOD!!!!! WHERE HAVE PEOPLE BEEN 
MAN! ZEPPELIN WON THE AWARD FOR GREAEST ROCK BAND ,LIKE EEEVVVEEERRR!!!!, 
and they are.40 FREAKING YRS. I WAS AT 12 of their concerts!Good thing my 
people are Rich.I even went to Europe 7 times,. Just to get closer to JIMMY 
PAGE, BUT SORRY JIMMY, I COULDNT GET AS CLOSE AS I WANTED, WE WOULD HAVE 
HAD SSOOOOO MUCH FUN TOGETHER! AND ROBERT, YOU AND JIMMY AND ME... "
"There best album ever. It also doesn't hurt to download these oldies onto 
music to listen to at work. That way nobody can complain. Who hates 
Journey? "
ROCK WILL NEVER DIE ! GREAT MUSIC CANT BEAT THE OLD STUFF 
"Groovy ... I'd sooner have a colonoscopy without lubrication than miss this awesome 
album. My Daughter was shocked that I knew almost every song! I laughed so 
hard & long I almost passed out!!! "
All time favorite. Ain't nothing better for a road trip. 
"best song awesome makes me sing anytime somehow I remember the words of song dont 
stop beleiving "
"Awesome Album! Even though I'm only 17, I grew up to these songs blasting in my dad's 
car. Love, love, love it! "
"Rock of ages They .made my life a movie and I was there. JOURNEY LIVE. Just a slice of 
heaven. Wish u were there...... "
5 If u didnt rate this a 5 u dont know music great album 
"This is good Even though this song is really old, its still good. "
"Amazing The lyrics are brilliant I love the new sound for this album. Well done! I 
recommend to listen to all the songs even if your not a fan you'll fall in 
love. "
"Bought at local store I bought this album on mistake. I didn't catch it until I got home. I 
opened it anyways instead of taking it back. there are only two tracks I 
don't care for on the whole album, and I usually buy a whole album just for 
2 songs. But very sad if someone actually had to go though the pain this 
guy does. I have drempt about a girl for weeks on end, only to never see 
her again. When you see a girl you like you better speak up cause Chances 
are you may never have the same opportunity to say what you want again. "
"I'm absolutely amazed. The first Arctic Monkeys song I had ever heard was Riot Van and it was one 
of my favorite songs. The Arctic Monkeys have outdone themselves with this 
album. Amazing. "
"Arrogant A very disappointing album. Arctic Monkeys seemed to have been killed by 
their arrogance spurned from their earlier, deserved success. Turner poses 
on stage with a very self confident manor which is not matched by the poor 
AM music "
"Grew on me I've come to very much enjoy this album, even though it took some time. 
There are many great tracks in it, and the lyrics are well-thought-through 
and, I thought, quite amusing at times (e.g. I Wanna Be Yours). "
"Disappointed If by 'consistent' you mean 'it all sounds the same' then I agree 
wholeheartedly. RU MINE is the only song on this album that seems to be 
worth listening to. I understand that a band's sound can't be the same 
throughout it's lifetime, but jeez, what happened? "
"A tall can of cool beans I can't stop listening to this album. The lyrics and the voice are so 
seductive and sensual. The Arctic Monkeys once again came through with 
another great album. "
"Amazing love this band and alex turner always and yes many say the songs sound the 
same but this album is filled with heartbreak and sorrow and love and 
confusion and it is all very perfect in my opinion "
"AM Brilliant album in a unique style that only AM could perfect. Not sure how 
haters can be haters of music this good! "
"Incredible. Without skipping a beat, Arctic Monkeys continues to expand what sounds 
they want to represent themselves with. Give it a few listens, and every 
song becomes a hit. It's a stylish blend of pop and rock and 
leather-jacket-wearing-badassery that only this artist could pull off. 
Between this and Suck It And See, they're easily my favorite band. "
"I liked Do I Wanna Know when I first heard it, so I gave the other singles 
a try. The first two I heard sounded so similar I mistook them for DIWK. ( 
Not to mention R U Mine? completely rips off Swamp Song by Blur) Arctic 
Monkeys have been swallowed up by Alex's newfound pretentiousness and it's 
horrible. I'll be in the corner, listening to Brianstorm. "
"One of the best. I was counting down the days until AM came out. It was so worth it. Bloody 
amazing. "
"Do I Wanna Know?' WHY YES, YES YOU DO. The band? Rocking. The lyrics are so much more 
in-depth when front-man Alex delves deeper into his confusing struggle of 
love from his more recent years. The bass and drums have definitely taken a 
new direction but it seems as if whichever route the band take to win over 
the hearts of their fans, those such as I, they will succeed and it is 
their sheer brilliance and total musical talent that allow them to do so. 
If the Arctic Monkeys don't win this, then I'm afraid the world has 
officially lost it's evermore-needed understanding of music provided by 
these lyrical geniuses that comprise to make the realist band out there - 
BY FAR. Never have I felt the need to love an inanimate object like it were 
a person until now - you can't help but fall in love! "
"Not as good as their older stuff Although the songs are good, the overall feel has evolved from the more 
cleansed feel of Suck it and See and detracted from the unpolished feel the 
band had with What Ever People Say, Favourite Worst Nightmare and the 
various unreleased songs and B-sides from their early days. Hopefully after 
their hiatus, they will revert back to their former, more unique self 
rather than moving further along this route and fulfilling the prophecy of 
the band in Fake Tales of San Francisco. "
"Wow! I'm always nervous when a band I love releases a new album, afraid that 
they will stray away from the sound I love. Arctic monkeys has been on of 
my favorite bands since 2006, and I have to say I was pleasantly shocked to 
hear this album! Their new style is great, I would describe it as ""cool"", 
""smooth"", and ""sexy"" especially one for the road and knee socks, where he's 
almost rapping in a way in parts of the song. I'm seeing them live at the 
state theatre, Portland Maine in two weeks, so excited! "
"One the best of 2013 AM seem to get better & better. So talented and unique sounding. Love, 
love, love them. They are FABULOUS live! Was fortunate enough to see them 
at the acl festival 2013 in Austin, Texas. Was into them a little prior to 
seeing them live, thanks to altnation on Sirius. After seeing them live, I 
am a fan and cannot get enough of AM! "
"Good but not there best. This album is miles better than the atrocious suck it and see, but no 
where near as good as their past albums. I was in love with this album the 
first two months of its release but some songs really get annoying. 
Specifically the ones where Matt sings, he should really stick to drumming. 
Besides that songs like r u mine and do you want know never get old because 
they sound original and are brilliant. "
"Outstanding The first album was good but this is their best. A lot more mature, 
musically and lyrically superior. Every song is a killa and there's a lot 
of musical styles on show from rock, soul, R&B to hip hop. Great album. 
'Arabella' is so influenced by 'Sabbath's' 'War Pigs'. Listen to it☺ "
"AMAZING this album never goes wrong, literally listened to the whole CD from 
beginning to end & loved it. These are my late night or sunset anthems., 
this is great music to be kicking back to, drink a beer and relaxing with 
friends "
"AMazing Love this new album. Love every song they've ever made. Saw them perform 
this album live the other night loved it. "
"It'll be remembered. They've rounded off all the edges and found a perfect sound. A classic 
album for a long time to come "
"Amazing. I listened to the most popular songs on this album and liked them. Then I 
listened to the ones that aren't as popular (Mad Sounds, Knee Socks, No. 1 
Party Anthem, etc.) and I adored them. I have them on vinyl and on my 
phone. I love it. Highly recommended. "
"Never gets old Some fantastically catchy tracks from the constant beating rhythm of Do I 
Wanna Know to the smooth Fireside - definitely worth the listen. "
"I love this band Amazing album. They continue to grow and change. I love how every album 
they put out has a new style and a new theme. "
"Arctic Monkeys at their best After purchasing any albums new and old this is defiantly my favourite, 
everything thing from banging guitar riffs to mellow piano vibes!Awesome "
"Incredibly Addictive album. Arctic Monkeys are amazing at making music that will get stuck in 
your head. "
Love it!! I love it . Its Pure amazing . I love Arabella . Arctic Monkeys Forever<33 
"Unreal... Went to see them live at Birmingham a couple of days ago and they were 
something else! They started with 'Do I Wanna Know?' and finished off with 
'R U Mine' - the stuff in between wasn't too bad as well I suppose haha "
"This band really spoke to my soul, they're extremely talented and I wish I 
bought this album sooner "
"Great album the songs stick in your head This album seems to only have 1 theme in the way that a lot of the songs 
sound the same . "
"Unreal... I saw them in concert last week in Tempe,Arizona. They were awesome. 
Arctic Monkeys are fantastic,fabulous, Ok unique. 2013 number one CD.^_^ "
"I love them They've opened my eyes with their music and this album really helped me 
open up "
"I. Love. This. Sfm. I need a leather jacket, a lit cigarette in my mouth, and to be surrounded 
by drugs. This album is complete magic. "
"Good, but not quite Artic Monkeys standard Talk about reproducing the same song a few times on an album you have it 
right here you only have to listen to the quick tasters Google give you and 
one can already tell they're similar. How ever the song being reproduced is 
good. The album is good but as a Mokeys fan it is not up to albums of the 
past "
"Not the best from them, but still pretty good. The arctic monkeys have had a lot of good songs, but most of them are 
spread around their albums. This album has the best value for the songs. It 
has a different sound, but they cant be teenagers in hoodies forever, bass 
lines are awesome. "
THE ARCTIC MONKEYS ARE WHY I WAS BORN THANK SWEET BABY JESUS THAT THEIR SONGS ARE ONLY 99 CENTS 
"Absolutely amazing They have really made that album that will last the ages like pink Floyd. 
Songs that will never be forgotten "
"Great album I love do I wanna know and arabella also r u mine overall this 
album is awesome has great lyrics "
"Loved it They were right when they said every song sounded like a single, but to be 
fair the sound quality of do I wanna know? Sounds iffy. "
"Superb First Monkeys album I heard and I love it just as much as I love all the 
others. Top quality. "
"5 Stars Ain't Enough Whiskey is an instant classic. Ready to hear the rest. I also 
pre-ordered. "
"Rock and roll. Kid Rock has firmly moved away from Rock / Rap. This is straight down the 
line southern rock and roll. First kiss is done to the tune of summer of 
69, which works well and FOAD is an enjoyable song....but a surprise if you 
don't know what FOAD stands for. "
"Great album Great sounds and themes. I like this MUCH better than any if that crap 
they're playing on the radio! "
"Such a let down from a great enterainer No upbeat stuff, all mellowed out. I could just imagine everyone sitting 
in the seats bored. "
"Kid Rock seems to never get old It's fun listening to an artist mature with you as you grow older. He 
takes leaps to different genres, risk taker, true artist. "
"He's finally getting good. The people who are saying he sold out are just stupid. His old music was 
selling out. Garbage pop music like ""I Wanna be a Cowboy."" He's developed 
an awesome, soulful, classic rock feel to his music and I actually enjoy 
hearing some of his songs now. "
"For people who appreciate real music. The people that don't like this haven't matured like kid Rock has. This 
falls into place with Bob Seger and lynyrd skynyrd, which is the real 
stuff. "
"Good Time, Laid Back Rock n' Roll Awesome.... No need to say more! "
I HATE IT CUTE ME SOME SLACK IM ONLY 9 AND I REALLY HATE IT 
Yeah im chris rock a lame loser Make better music dumass 
"First Kiss I love the album but I can't find it on my phone it was there for a little 
bit but now can't find it anywhere. Dint want to buy it again "
"HATE IT Two words to describe teribble, stupid and to expensive HATE IT "
"Pre-ordered I pre-ordered the album about 2 weeks ago and when I refreshed my music it 
wasn't there so I went to play store and it shows that I need to pay for 
it. Please give me the album I PAID for. "
"First Kiss! Kid...This song is AEESOME! So glad to see you cross over to the Rockside! 
I have never been a rap fan. Welcome!!! Love this song!!! "
"Home run AGAIN! Kid Rock does it again! I love every song on this album. His style hits me 
just right, and I can't get enough! "
Kid Rock...Need we say more. You won't be sorry. Just buy it and enjoy. 
"My Man Kid Rock is the best show in rock today. And he rocks the house on this 
one. "
"8/10 Very mellow compared to his old stuff but iv been a fan since the 
beginning and feel he has aged with his music and so have i. Grab a whiskey 
and chill out with this on :-) "
"Kid Rock! Hey ...Look at that kid Rock!! Im crazy inlove with this music and First 
Kiss is soooo great! Keep doing what you love Kid! ♥ "
"The Kid has grown up! Absolutely love this album. I put it at the top of my 
list. If you don't love it. FOAD! "
"Love the FOAD fits with me a lot love where your songs are going. Look 
forward to hearing more great songs. "
Kid Rock This is what's missing now a days :loving it !! Every song... 
"FIRST KISS Evolving, yes! Still great, yes! Keep rocking it Kid Rock "
"Can't tell what's ripped off more... Summer of '69 or his ex's Soak up the Sun. Seriously, you're not kid rock 
anymore, you're kid hack "
Ok Could do better see a few good tracks on here not many 
"Desperate attempt to pay the bills. Kid used to be cool now he is old and 
drools "
Can't wait Every time Kid Rock touches a guitar it turns to gold!!! I can't wait!!! 
Rebel Soul Kid Rock is fantastic. He's come along way 
Kid rock first kiss So true takes you back to better times 
"Have always like Kid Rock's music Love this song..... ""First Kiss"" "
It's Awsome I love this song great lyrics. awesome songs in this album.;D 
Kid rock first kiss! We love all kid. Rock. Drinking beer with Dad!! 
"At His Best! Starting with FIRST KISS - every song is a classic! Kid Rock - U have done 
it again! Rock On! "
"F.O.A.D Great title For kid soft last 7 cds the rock has died and no amount of viagra Is gonna 
raise him up. "
"Love Kid Rock, this one didn't disappoint me either. "
"Great Album Kid Rock's best music in years. The Songs First Kiss & Ain't Enough Whisky 
are great. Enough Said. "
Gettin soft Kid! Nothin like Cocky! 
"What a let down... Who the hell talked the Kid into making this crap? Makes me want to burn 
all his albums and forget he existed. "
"8 rows from Stage! Been of fan of Kid since I was in grade school, my first concert was in 
2004, I was only 10! And now I'm seeing him 11 years later!! "
Great Always been a big fan of kid rock keep it common kid 
"Damn I missed these guys T_T That feeling in Ashes of Eden and the energy in Never Again (sigh) what a 
relieve they're back, great birthday present :) "
"More of the same, but thats not bad Some might say that sounding like your older stuff is a bad thing, but 9 
years after ""Dear Agony"" and a line-up change, it's nice to know if you 
loved them then, you shouldn't find anything too scary "
"A Long Awaited Arrival Let me start of by saying this... This album is probably the best from 
them ever! It's not easy to re-group and put together an all new lineup, 
while still sounding the same as with the Phobia and Dear Agony albums. 
Waited 6 effin' years for this! Totally was worth the wait! Personally my 
favorite songs off this album are #1 Bury Me Alive, #2 Failure & #3 
Defeated. Once again this epic album you should hear, even if you don't 
like rock/alternative... Do yourself a favor & listen to it, you won't 
regret it! "
"I love breaking Benjamin. I listen to them ALLLLL the tie but this, as much 
as iv tried to like it...I just don't. It is not their best piece of work, 
very disappointing :( "
"Free song...... Aren't we suppose to get ""Failure"" now and the rest of the album on June 
23rd. I pre ordered and didnt get the song. Will change when I get my song. "
"Waited to rate until I heard the whole album. Unlike others. Lol. Breaking Benjamin is one of the few bands that can actually have great 
albums other than their 1st album. It's hard to do but everyone of their 
albums is hard rock greatness! I hope many more come from this band! "
"Love the new album! Been waiting a long time. It had been a long time since we'd seen a Breaking Benjamin album, and I'm 
not disappointed at all! Love this new album! "
"Breaking Benjamin is back! The wait was totally worth it. Their sound and style remains true to how 
it was before their hiatus. Very nostalgic yet very refreshing to hear new 
content. Welcome back BB! "
"Fantastic The album is fantastic. Breaking Benjamin restored my faith in the music 
industry. They made an awesome record filled with feelings from Ben's 
stories. Long live rock! "
"Good comeback Nice to finally hear some new material from them. Dear Agony is still my 
favourite, but this is cool. "
"The perfect comeback to a highly-anticipated band! They did an amazing job with their comback album! It sounds a bit darker 
than songs I've heard from these guys in the past, but I'll be damned if 
they dont sound amazing! "
"The band going from a 4-piece to a 5-piece makes the music sounds tighter. 
On most BB CDs I have usually 6-8 tracks I keep in regular rotation. I can 
say all but two songs on here (including the intro ""Dark"" and the outro 
""Dawn"") will be in my playlist. I love the element of more backing vocals 
on this one, and the ultrasound of his son on the cover was a cool little 
Easter Egg. Plucking Jason Rauch from Red, and Keith Wallen from Copper are 
opportunities you just can't pass up, and Ben looks like he's having fun on 
stage for the first time in many years. So, who was that Valora band that 
was the catalyst for the last four years of tribulation?! Oh yeah...nowhere 
to be found. "
"Pennsylvania rock at it's finest Ben and the new band have outdone themselves for sure. I've been a fan 
since 2002 when Saturate took off with Polyamorous. They make me proud to 
be from Pa and watching them grow over the years has touched me. This new 
installment of songs is honest and quite frankly, possibly some of their 
best material to date. Buy this album and check out the boys on tour. You 
won't regret it!!! "
"Glad to have a new album It's a bit too much like Dear Agony for me. Would love to see a return to 
the style of Phobia or Saturate. Either way, glad to have Breaking Benjamin 
back! "
"An album not to be missed Breaking Benjamin went through a serious change, Ben Burnley himself went 
through serious changes. And he's still sick, but said he chooses to write, 
perform and melt our faces over letting his sickness win the fight. I 
support the overall goal and message this band is delivering. It is a 
testament to everything he has experienced over the last few years 
including the welcoming of a new child. This album brings a lot of 
nostalgia to mind and I rarely write reviews. This merits one. "
"All of the songs are amazing Breaking Benjamin dark before dawn its incredible welcome back Ben after 6 
year you came back stronger than ever. "
"Amazing I haven't ordered it on Google play since its available on Spotify and 
I've already downloaded it on iTunes but this is an awesome album anyways. 
I've listened for many years and have loved every album ever since their 
first. Ashes of Eden is personally my favorite track on the album (I've 
been listening to the album on iTunes first play for at least a week). So 
glad BB is back! "
"Nothing short of perfection. This year went the way I thought it would: Three Days Grace disappointed 
me, Breaking Benjamin's ""Dark Before Dawn"" did not. "
"I've waited so long for this album. This band saved my life. I was in a 
very dark place when I stumbled across Breaking Benjamin. Some days, their 
music was the only escape I had from the hell around me. I was disappointed 
when I seen that they had gone their separate ways, but ohh the joy when I 
learned of this release. You guys rock! This sounds awesome. You guys are 
definitely clooose to heaven!! If not heaven itself. Keep up the fantastic 
sound!! "
"Good to be back The wait between Dear Agony and now was long, but definitely worth it! 
Great album! "
"What the hell? I preordered, never got my free song and now I have to PAY TO LISTEN TO 
THIS ALBUM (after a 30 day free trial)? Screw your first month free, give 
me a refund. I'll go spend an extra few bucks on a CD. This is ridiculous. "
"Amazing This so far is the best album I've ever heard, amazing comeback for 
Breaking Benjamin, loved Ashes Of Eden "
"Philly girl loving this group since they began. This album rocks! ! If your 
a BB fan, this one is a must have! Thank you BB for not letting us down, 
your the best! ! Forever your fan.. I'm from Philly, and love the new album from BB, Thank you, you rock BB!! "
"Best Band Ever I have been listening to them since I was very little so to hear there 
music not change over the years has been very comforting and ok inspiring 
to me. Keep it up BB you guys are great love your music. "
"Ben at his best I first encountered Breaking Benjamin thanks to Halo at 12 years old. 11 
years later Ben has still not disappointed, another great album with 
perfect lyrics and amazing musicianship. My only concern with Breaking 
Benjamin is that I may never have the privilege of seeing them live! "
"Best band ever Breaking Benjamin, with the new lineup, still sounds as awesome as ever. I 
was stoked to find out they made a new album, and, it's just a great as I'd 
hoped it would be. This would be the first band I'd recommend to anyone. 
Absolutely love them. "
"The best I've loved breaking Benjamin since I was 16 bens music has helped me out 
in so many ways I can't explain I hope you guys never retire any time soon 
thanks for the music guys "
"AWESOME Finally got it and finished listening to this art and truely love it and 
love breaking benjamin "
"Issues with preorder? anyone else having problems with the preorder down load?? Don't wanna buy 
the songs and then have them charge me another 10 bucks.. aside from this, 
it's a fantastic album! "
"D b4 D Not even gonna hype it up... Just listen 2 it...Just nay b the best music 
2 come out in 2015.!?# kid u not!!! Trust me :) "
"Love this band! I have been listening to breaking Benjamin for probably 10 plus years and 
once I found out they were making a new album I was excited and they still 
impress me. Even with how music is changing in today's world breaking 
Benjamin still manages to keep the great sound of rock that I love! "
"Finally! I've been a fan of Breaking Benjamin for almost a year now, and I love 
every one of their songs. Sadly, I don't have any of their albums. Mainly 
because my parents are strict about what I listen to... Anyway, I was 
listening to Pandora on my phone, and ""Failure"" came on for the first time. 
When I saw it was by Breaking Benjamin, I freaked out! I couldn't believe 
they we're finally making music again! I just asked my grandma to buy this 
album for me when it comes out, and she said yes! I'm so excited!! :D "
"Awesome Album Welcome Back Awesome Album Dear Agony was Cool But This One Is Great Played It All The 
Way Threw With No Skipping It's A Dark Album And I Love That "
"Back in stride! Breaking Benjamin have come back with a lot of gusto on this record. It's 
heavy, it's melodic, and the new members are just as talented if not more 
so than the old lot. The guitar work is tight and the mix isn't overdone; 
it packs a nice punch and nothing is lost. Ben's vocal harmonies are better 
than ever. This is among their best work. My only gripe is it's too short 
but, it's still way better than Dear Agony! If you liked Phobia, you'll 
love Dark Before Dawn. "
"New perspective. Changed my rating after listening to the album from a new perspective and 
it's a work of art. I've been a fan since Saturate and am still a doe hard 
fan. "
"Same old Breaking Benjamin, with a weaker band behind Ben Breaking Benjamin certainly has a consistent sound, but it has gotten to a 
point where there is no longer an allure to the band's music. On top of 
Breaking Benjamin's redundancy, the instrumental band is arguably worse 
than year's past, even with Jasen Rauch in the mix. The music is so even 
keel, with no ups and down, no surprises. For me, it's not worth the 
purchase. One album listen through was enough. "
"100 percent enjoyable no reason to dislike it. It breaking bejamin greatest 
band known to the universe in my oppinion all of you should vote five stars 
to inspire them. Because they deserve it. GO BREAKING BENJAMIN!! "
"Near Perfection Literally a band that can't put out a bad album. They prepubescent it 
again here with a perfect mix of great lyrics to song along with and more 
amazing playing. Truly one of the best bands in the rock scene. "
"So excited I love everything this band has put out. All four albums were great start 
to finish. Don't blame then for keeping the same formula despite the new 
members and the 5 year hiatus "
"(Failure)A perfect mix of all the older albums The intro reminds me of some cold, the guitar is more dear agony album, 
but the over all feel of the song is more melodic like phobia not as 
dark,but the new vocal melody is beautifully done ,I think to let fans know 
it's still the breaking benjamin you know and love ,but I'm sure the best 
is yet to come as it has on all there albums the first singles were never 
best songs on the album "
"GREAT! A fantastic feel to it! I normally don't do a whole lot of country, but I 
will definitely make an exception for this. "
"Best Album I've listened to in awhile Cole Swindell's debut album is the best album I've listened to in a while. 
There isn't a bad song on this album. "
"Great debut album Just saw Cole open for Luke Bryan and had to run out and buy this right 
away! Cole is a quadruple threat. He is an amazing song writer, singer, 
performer and has boyish good looks and charm to boot. Mark my words, Cole 
will be a superstar some day! "
"Awesome! Amazing performer. Amazing voice. This album just screams super star. I 
saw him witH Luke Bryan and Lee BRice and he didn't even perform like a new 
kid on the block. It was amazing! He was born to sing. "
"COLE SWINDELL First Album Released. I'm Not Much Into Country Music, But Like Country 
Rock. This Has A COUNTRY ROCK Feel To It & I'm Not Passing It Up. 
Especially For Free. Thank You Google Play. "
"Great Album Catchy tunes, lyrics are fun and definitely not a bad song on the whole 
album! "
"Agree with GEOrROX4 - isn't there a way to bypass the credit card/Paypal 
acct. info? When I download free apps I am able to just click continue.... "
"Love it! Has all the songs that I listen to on a daily basis! Kind of wish I waited 
to just get it on here before purchasing the album on iTunes. "
"Hey y'all This album's got an awesome feel good vibe, let it play from the beginning 
you won't regret it !! All the songs are good...!!? "
"Not huge country person but this guy has insanely soothing voice and this 
album is one of best albums with song after song of great country hits . 
About to go buy me some boots and go 2 stepping ,or maybe I'll just turn it 
up "
"I can't believe this album is FREE! Download this album if you like Country 
music because GoiglePlay album of the week only last one week. "
"Come on Google You see what tops the charts. And it isn't this crap. Coming from someone 
who used to live and breathe country, country all sounds the same now. New 
age country is all the same garbage just different voices. Luke Bryan, Cole 
Swindell, Brantley Gilbert, and all these other garbage singers are ruining 
it. Someone found a sound that will easily top the country radio's charts, 
so now everyone uses it for every song. And it works. Country just sucks 
now. Period. "
"I don't usually listen to country music... Bur when I do, I listen to Cole Swindell. Trust me. Listen to every song 
on preview and then you will know $10 is worth it. "
"Chillin'it, and diggin'it! Every once in a while, a song really grabs you and won't let go! For me, 
""ain't worth the whiskey"" certainly is worth the whiskey! J.D. to be 
specific. He's gotten me to love country music even more than I already 
did. Cole has just got ""it"", very bright future! Love it! "
"Great album but downloading doesn't work from google play music to my 
windows 8.1 PC "
"Is the most touching Hart felt song ! Swidndell surprisingly performance is 
also very censier honest and a tear driper love his voice he is going to be 
definitely around to give us more of writing..... best wishes Road Ridgway "
"Right under Luke Bryan! Got the Chance to meet Cole nicest guy in the world! He's gonna be 
trailing Luke Bryan in no time! "
"Love, Love, Love! I have fallen in love with this album...Every single song! Get it, you 
won't regret it . "
"Crap What a piece of trash this is, ""Hey Y'All??"" What a dumb hick "
"<3 amazing I love Cole Swindell! All of his songs are amazing and wonderful. He has a 
beat that no other country artist has and I absolutely love it! Especially 
Hey Y'all! "
"OK Yawn...more bro country. Yet another missed opportunity to make GREAT 
music by settling for mediocre music. Talented singer, but a very 
forgettable track list with nothing that stands out. "
"Love it Ain't your tipical COUNTRY guy but love this one cuz it's fresh,cool to 
listening plus hey I just want to chill it "
Awesome I'm cousins with Clint the drumer player and back up guitar player 
"Awesome artist! I changed from fla ga line ring back to Cole Swindell!!, "
Ain't worth the whiskey Song follows me everywhere I go and can't get it out of my head 
"Won't let me actually download to my device. I can listen to it while here 
on Google play and have technically downloaded it, but it never showed up 
on my phone. "
Love the music Hope you get lonely to night is my favortie 
Cole Swindell rock.. Great first album by another Sigma Chi alumni. 
"Got the album free from Google as a promo. Fun album to listen to even 
though I don't usually enjoy country. "
"NEW COUNTRY AT ITS BEST!! Gotta love Cole Swindell. He has a great voice and an awesome way of song 
writing. This whole album is just ""Feeling"", You feel a different emotion 
with each song."" Ain't Worth The Whiskey"", is my favorite with ""Hope You 
Get Lonely Tonight"", right there with it. Highly recommend getting it if 
you love Great country music. "
WooHoo I can't believe I never heard this album before! Excellent 
Cole S is amazing and sexy This album is crazy good. Great work Cole. Xoxoxoxo 
Changed me and can't even listen to it Wtf I paid for a song I can't even listen to 
Love his voice and way he makes the music come alive 
I expected a couple of good songs but it was surprisingly fantastic! 
Ain't worth the whiskey Very touching emotional song. Absolutely love this song. 
"Love Country Music. Excellent voice. I just going to say that COLE born to sing and I wish the 
BEST of the BEST to him. Thanks for your beautiful voice. "
"Great Album Fun songs, easy listening and should be great in concert. "
"You need this album! I've loved Cole Swindell's music since I heard ""Ain't worth the whiskey"". 
It's been my favorite song for about a year. This guy is going to be one of 
Countries biggest artist ever. Every song on this album puts a smile on 
your face. I could turn on repeat and be stoked to hear every song no 
matter how long I've been listening. CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS NEXT ALBUM! "
Love it Wished i could of seen you here in redding though... 
"It is epic!! All my friends ( other than me an 2 others, ) say that she is not 
appropriate. I now that is not true, I may only like the songs Roar, Dark 
Horse and Fire Work, but I know she is one of the best people who have ever 
lived!!! "
"Awesome To all the negative people nobody cares that you didn't like this album it 
was awesome and she doesn't need your input she has already broken heaps of 
records and she should be proud. I love love this album well done Katy way 
to keep with the expectations "
"Sounds like old Navy music I've always liked her but I feel like most of these songs are something 
you would hear as you shop at old Navy... Their music selection sucks... 
Disappointed to say the least. I liked 2 songs and it's the 2 she has 
released already... Better luck next time "
"Awesome! I haven't even bought this yet and I feel the need to give it a 5 star 
rating......I so badly wish I had $20 right now....can't wait to buy this 
album!!! "
"Amazing!!!!❤ I have the whole prism but as soon as they came out with the prism deluxe 
I I bought the additional songs and just added it to my first prism album. 
And the whole prism album for me was only $5 so if you buy the regular 
album and then the additional songs it will save you money. But I also love 
all the songs on this album the song I'm not very happy with is birthday I 
really can't feel anything coming out I couldn't feel what she was going 
through. But with dar oMG I can't even start with what I was feeling "
"Same old pop crap When will this woman change things up a bit.., she rarely ventures outside 
the box, and copies other artist's characteristics and strengths (Lady 
Gaga), and has played it safe in the music industry for years!!! Girl 
please. "
"KATY YOU CAN DO BETTER But I LOVED 'By The Grace Of Jesus' and the chorus of ""Choose Your 
Battles"" . "
"Amazing! Seriously, there's always haters for every band/singer. But everyone's 
entitled to their opinion. If you like her go ahead. If you want to start 
listening to her, try it. {Pst, Dark Horse rocks!} "
"Showing her true face here Really am rating this halfway by listening to the samples, but a couple of 
these songs have got me close to tears! They are definitely ones which can 
be related to. Haven't heard her other albums, but judging from her singles 
alone, I would say she has taken a step in the right direction here. So I 
am planning on looking for a physical copy of this. I've never been much a 
fan of Katy Perry until these past two days. It's always great to see an 
artist improve. "
"Katy Perry (Prism) album I love this album, I was not a real katy perry listener but I happened to 
hear a few songs I liked not on this album that I didnt know were performed 
by katy perry once I figured it was her had to listen to other album, plus 
my husband loves her music. Great work, look forward to more "
"I love it It's so good. It has so pure and meaningful songs, so elegant, but it 
still has very funny and empowering songs. Love you Katy Perry! "
"Wonderful It is full of fun and up beat songs. It isn't depressing at all if you 
feel sad just listen to this and dance. "
"Its Amazing!!! I bought this 8 months ago & I still love all the songs, I love Katy 
Perry!! I swear, their is nothing that she can't do. I can't wait to see 
her perform at the Super Bowl next year !! "
"What? Sorry Katy, I love you, but I'm not to impressed with this album. There 
are a few good songs, but not a whole lot spoke to me. :/ "
"LOVE YOU screw the people who hate you with there negative comments Katy Perry is 
awesome and if you negative people like to say negative things then don't 
say anything at all dont make people feel bad when they try their best "
"DEVIL ANIMAL Devil freak Why u crossed over all these people that sell they souls to 
the devil are going to burn in hell real.talk so have fun being alive for 
now!!!! "
"Gotta love the ""sid"" reviews Really love getting reviews on music from ""experts"" like Sid. Here's a 
news flash Sid, if you have to tell people that they are too young or old 
to understand ""good"" music, it is actually YOU who doesn't understand good 
music. Get a life dude and stop living in a ""Final Fantasy"" world. "
"stolen copyrights Most people don't know this but She stole the beat on Dark horse from a 
Christian rapper. Pretty lame move, should have came up with her own stuff 
rather than steal from other artists. "
"Ali When i first heard dark horse, i loved it and still do but i recognize the 
music and lyrics from a song years ago. Then I read it was from a Christian 
musician. If that's the case the Christian songster stole it from an older 
song? There's an old saying that all artists are thieves, not a bad thing, 
just reality. "
"love katy perry!!!! i love katy perrys songs including albums like prism. the only thing is 
that why does it have to cost money for every song. i would rather use 
spotify. anyway, i love love love katy perry!!!!!!! "
All her best songs So many cool songs on one album to bad i don't have money to buy it 
"Dull A disappointing follow up to Teenage Dream. All spark and fun is gone, the 
majority of tracks are plodding and go nowhere - this album is the sound of 
a broken heart. "
"Songs that can connect to a person, whenever they are in the mood for it. I really like this album. I mean yea some songs can be boring but if you 
listen long enough on some of them,then there could be an awesome chorus or 
beat. "
"Love love love :) Such a relatable album. Love internationally smile, it takes two and 
double rainbow. Katy perry did this album great justice and im so pleased 
with these songs. "
"Please stop my ears are bleeding Its such a shame that this woman actually does have a great singing 
voice... if only she'd sing songs that have actual meaning/emotion behind 
them. She's regurgitating the same old crap over and over. Not to mention 
she completely hogs the radio and takes up space that possibly rising 
artists could use to broadcast their songs. Quality over quantity, Katy. "
"Love!! I love Katy Perry. Such an amazing voice. Faves on this album: Dark Horse 
and Unconditionally. Loved 'Roar' but got a little boring after a while... "
"For you The people that ""hate"" on this album wouldn't be here reading the reviews 
for this.so words/time wasted can never be recouped.let's make this clear 
here,I don't want to change anybody's mind,just offer another perspective. 
They hate it for being different and we love it for being unique no one 
else's opinion matters about our preference and it is a complete waste of 
time to worry.enjoy life and let ""them"" do to themselves. "
"Katy Perry suprises me... I THOUGHT HER MUSIC WAS KIND OF COOKY AND LAME. A LOT OF THE SONGS SOUNDED 
THE SAME. Her new albums are a nice change,my 12 yr old can listen and I 
can too. I even bought tic I ets to two of her uocoming concerts. "
Good. More of the same from Katy Perry. That's not a bad thing! I liked it. 
"A new Katy I have always loved her, but with this album I really became a KatyCat. 
She has so many nice songs, the most vulnerable being 'By the grace of god' 
and other very inspirational or meaningful ones. Try the album for 
yourself, stream it or listen to demos before you buy it, because so many 
reviews are saying it isnt meaningful and it's pop crap, but that really 
depends where you are in life. Haha especially the one saying to go buy 
Miley Cyrus or Justin Timberlake instead, well thats just your taste I 
guess. "
"Creative! I love how creative the lyrics are. I really feel what she is trying to 
say. What a great album! "
"Wow Katy Perry is amazing and obviously if u say u don't like the album it 
just because this is not your type of music so really before u by it 
preview the songs first so you can get a feel of the album before you buy 
it. Just because you hear one of her old songs that u like doesnt mean your 
gonna like a whole album. but this album is astonishing! Buy it! "
"Good pop music This album will not change your life in any meaningful way. It will 
entertain you if you like catchy pop melodies. Sometimes the sex appeal 
gets in the way, but the songs on this album are always more important than 
the fact that Katy Perry is beautiful. I only wish that were the case with 
Lady Gaga, whose collaborators seem to think her weak sexed-up Christina 
Aguilera impression is somehow ""innovative"". "
"Kudos Katy! I like the new step Katy has taken. She has some fun songs to dance to and 
very inspiring songs. I love it. "
"She's a Brilliant Musical Force I have loved her positive, vulnerable, & fresh music from the 1st song I 
heard. She keeps reinventing herself & growing. Her choice of notes & 
songwriting blow me away. She has a positive message & is genuine & sweet. 
And the NOTES she can hit! Wow! Another great in my opinion. "
"#DarkHores Katy Perry is really talented I sing a little bit and I hope I can be as 
good as her she is the best and I hope too meet her and she can give me 
some help. I'm only 12 no one here's me sing cuz I only sing in front of my 
friends and barley in front of my mom. I'm not that pretty either or have 
that perfect body but my friends say I have a good voice and I should do 
something with it. So if anybody here's this plz tell me what I should do. 
I'm lost and scared if I don't sound good I may loose my dream:-( "
"Best yet from Katy I love all the tracks on this CD. I expected so much when I saw it, I 
bought the deluxe version. I wasn't disappointed, and hadn't wasted £3 on 3 
more (epic) tracks. It's started off with the Summer 2013 hit 'Roar'. To be 
totally honest, this is the worst track on the CD, so if you liked 'Roar', 
you love 'Prism'. I have Katy's other two more recent albums and this beats 
'One of the Boys' & 'Teenage Dream' (even the Complete Confection edition) 
by far. An EPIC BUY, and worth its price tag. "
"Greattt I never loved Katy Perry to much but I think I like her a lot more by 
listening to these :) "
It ..... I .......AMAZING I cant say anything good because this is amazing♥♡♡♥♥ 
"Awesome Good job katy.. .. liked dark. horse best song ever. All those people that 
rated it one star you try writing a song . She did great! 5 stars. "
"Awesome This guy sings authentic good old fashioned music that sounds amazing. 
Bought the whole album its amazing. "
"Save it for a rainy day Love this song, makes me feel great!!!! "
"I love Kenny. I've grew up listening to him and his music is truly amazing. 
I hope he never retires. There's so many great songs on this album. I 
remember thinking a few year ago before this album came out that I'm going 
to miss those songs and was wondering how is he going to make music as 
great as his last album ""Hemming Whiskey"" & the same thing with ""Welcome To 
The Fishbowl"" but every album he manages to make another great album. This 
is why Kenny Chesney is my favorite artist. "
"Excellent I have been a long time fan of KC. Have seen him live four times, one show 
better than the next. Unfortunately though, I have found much of his new 
music after the ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem"" album to be mediocre at 
best. Fortunately, his new album ""The Big Revival"" is a return to form on a 
grand scale. I knew he had this album in him somewhere. Buy it. This will 
go down as one of his best. Lots of feel good, party tunes. Can't wait to 
see him live next Summer. "
"Awesome His concert was awesome in Atlanta last night and his album is very very 
good to and I love the way he interacts with the crowd "
"The Big Revival Kenney Chesney's music & his winning down to earth personality & that 
seductive smile & of course his handsomeness (if that is a word) . I can't 
say enough of my first & favorite heart throb. I'd hurt down and whip any 
woman one earth if I lnew any that ever hurt him, All he'd have to do would 
be to call me & I'll be there. Love you always Kenney. You've made this 
Mississippi Small Town Girl smile a bunch of years now by being you & doing 
what you do. Every fan needs to seriously. buy this album! PEACE! "
"Stooooked ! I'm SO SO stoked for this album. I was having serious withdrawals of his 
stadium tour this year. I've been to the last 3 and there is seriously 
nothing like it. Bravoo !! "
Country's. Best!! Kenny hits u right!!! Right WHERE. It needs to be hit. EverY 'tIme 
"The hillbilly rock star is back I want to hang out at the Flora-bama. Best album since Hemingway's 
Whiskey. "
"Tampa tailgate lot 6 crew here Can't wait to hear the whole album and can't wait for the new tour. Kenny, 
Please kick it off in Tampa again. I'm planning my stay in March soon so 
hopefully a date is decided! Can't wait to see everyone again. Jon, Tambo 
on the cart hitting the lots and broadcasting from our tailgate on NSR. 
Will be sad not seeing Matt P. this year. "
I would'nt mind going coastal on that bus Cuz when i close my eyes i'd be somewhere you 
"Kenny sings good old time time Country , the type of music that gives you a 
cold chill on a warm sunny day! "
Big revial Love love love kenny u have outdone yourself once again 
American Kids Like he's singing about my high school years! Love it!! 
"American Kids Another Awesome Album. Kenny Chesney you are an Amazing Country Music 
Singer!!! "
"Country Singer Storyteller Kenny is the Jimmy Buffett of Country Music... That is what I hear & feel 
when I hear is lyrics to his music.... "
"It's about time someone developed something that really can help me get 
more out of my telephone thank you "
"Fantastic song writing and sound, stories to respect Puts heart and originality back in country "
"Amazing Has to be one of his best albums. Even with the shift in a new direction I 
found that I loved nearly every song on this one. I've played the hell out 
of it! Also the Big Revival tour this year was amazing. If you're a fan, 
go! You'll have the time of your life. No shoes nation! "
"Never disappoints I love KC, he is everything an entertainer should be. ❤ "
It would have been better if it was just Kenny Chesney 
"Another winner. Up beat, easy listening. Alone or with friends and parties! "
Love Kenny Chesney American Kids reminds me when I grew up 
"Another hit! I'd say the time taken off was well spent....a lot of good 
songs writen "
Brilliant This record really shows off kennys talent. Can't stop listening to it 
"The Big Revival This is a completely different sound for Kenny, and after one listen, to 
me, it's the best he has ever done by far... It is truly a most have. "
"Great different album I haven't really been a fan of his other albums but I absolutely love this 
one! "
Another great album Looking forward to hearing it Live 
"American Kids I love this song the first time I heard it in my uncles car after it was 
finished I looked it up on Google just to hear it again you should also 
should listen to play it again by Luke Brian and stronger by Carrie 
Underwood "
American Kids Amazing inappropriate lovely similar to life song 
Kenny Big man Kenny does it again..... Phenomenal album 
Awsome!! I love him awsome country artist's 
"Always Amazing I will forever be a fan of this man. He is just so well grounded, talented 
and just perfect. I love him and I will always love him. Good job Kenny. 
See you next year! "
Kenny always puts out a great cd!! 
Yay Best album I've ever listened too. KENNY CHESNEY!!!!
