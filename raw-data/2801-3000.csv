"X go hard I really do love this album...only one song didn't really didn't do it for 
me was ""don't be too long""..i don't buy albums.often & i got my money worth "
"Decent Album Not the best, not the worst. Doesn't really help that half of the album 
were released as singles for the past year, along with songs getting 
leaked. I think ""X"" and ""lost in ya love"" are probably my favorites. "
"Chris brown I love you Chris brown I would like to see you and I now you like Michael 
Jackson I love him too he is the best man for ever I love his songs and his 
dance I will never for get him. You look like Michael Jackson when you 
dance I would like to see you Chris brown. "
"Surprisingly since there were so many tracks. Thought I would be bored but 
this album's hot!! "

Go Chris! I enjoy this album. It was refreshing. My favorite song is Drunk texting! 
"❌ chris has done it again!! he is so diverse with his stylistic versatility 
& still makes it wonderful!! #majorslayage "
"Not his best This is actually the first complete album I've gotten of his and it was 
good but I know he's done better though but I recommend people to get it 
though. "
Amazing!!! 5 Starz BREEZY. Has done it again! I'M loving this Album! Worth The Wait!! 
"I love all your songs! Chris you just keep doing your thing! God I love 
youu. The XALBUM is just amazing "
"Whole thing is good The bomb especially ""stereotype"" and ""do better"". Excellent work! "
"OMG!!! I don't usually listen to Chris Brown but this album is flawless. I 
have to say this album is on point and creative. My Favorites are: Time For 
Love (#1) Drunk Texting, Songs on 12 Play, 101(Interlude), (Lady in a Glass 
Dress (Interlude) and Loyal. But all the other songs are flawless. Chris 
has really Outdone himself and I would call myself a fan. GREAT JOB OMG 
IT'S TOO LONG THO BUT STILL LOVE IT SINCE THE DELUXE IS BETTER. THE OTHER 
ONE IS FLAWLESSS TOO BASICALLY THO I DON'T LOVE IT LESS "
"Another Superior Album I am never disappointed when it comes to Chris' talent. His aesthetics are 
excellent and this album is another point of proof. You cant go wrong when 
buying anything of his. I've been Team Breezy since 05 and I will always 
support him. I love every song on this album. It is an album that I can 
just press play and let it roll. I love it! Awesome job, Chris! Xoxo "
"Trey215 This was a good and we'll put together album by Chris Brown I really 
enjoyed how he keep it R&B but gave you some of the techo sound as 
well.Autumn Leaves is prolly my favorite track out of all but overall good 
album by Chris u can listen all the way threw without skipping a track. "
"X The Album Not the best he has ever put out, but I still love it! Of course there are 
few songs I didn't like, but many people have been waiting on his album. 
Job well done. "
"Sensational Definitely the hottest album out now imo, lost in ya love, stereotype, & X 
are my favorite, all the songs are great though!!!! "
"Yesss I love Chris Brown so much! This album has such a variety of styles in his 
songs! This man is such a genius and I love being entertained by his 
amazing talent! I would definitely recommend this album to EVERYONE!! Team 
Breezy forever!! "
"This album is awesome Nothing could ever change the fact that Chris Brown has a beautiful, 
soulful, angelic voice and this album showcases that perfectly. I love the 
rhythm and sounds of this entire album. It is so perfect for putting on 
when you have some time to enjoy yourself. "
"RnB King Excellent music! Been a long wait but thoroughly worth it. The greatest 
entertainer since MJ is back once again with a massive bang. Breezy 
delivers as always! "
"This album is amazing. I have been a chris brown fan forever so of course I 
love this album but it truly is good. Some very good songs besides loyal, 
new flame, fine China, don't think they know, and love more on here is came 
to do and time for love "
"This CD suck's Y Chris Brown Y.........Y Do You Make Bad Music again n again just stop 
please thankyou....... and you only have 1 good song so far and it is X' 
that's it..... "
"It's good... Chris has had better albums......and I feel like he rushed this album 
because he trying to redeem himself from all the crap that has happened... 
but he has some hits on here (( X, New Flame , 101 interlude, Add me in,, 
Don't be gone to long )) I absolutely adore Chris but he can do MUCH better 
, it's a good album it's has great songs I still LOVE chris "
"Great Job I LOVE THIS ALBUM! GREAT SONGS AND A GREAT VIBE! FINALLY ITS BACK TO THE

"Yall kno I love chris brown I'm addicted to this guy.. Nd his songs. I could listen to his songs all

"incredible album,perfect flow of an r&b album with a diverse arrangement 
from soulful to pop from sensual to party & turn up,plus the song writing 
is always next level,just everything you expect from Chris & his caliber of 
artistry..great work "
"Love love love it This is a great album. I got two deluxe. Breezy fan for life. Autumn 
leaves, drunk texting, 12 play, the one sound like Micheal Jackson, fine 
china. And all the rest. ;) "
"In love! I can't stop dancing to thus album. Chris always comes back harder than 
before, my favs so from this are New Flame, Loyal, and Fine China. I love 
how the album flows but still doesn't sound like your hearing the same song 
over and over again. I'm in heaven! Go CHRIS! "
"Forget about chris brown himself, although he has done bad, he has a great 
voice and really knows how to make a song. Although a few of these song 
were more commercial and were made for attention for the album such as 
loyal, the songs are great and I think the delux is the best because of 
fine china, that song is so good "
"Love it! I listen to it everyday! My favorites are. Do Better, Drunk Texting, Body 
Shots, Autumn leaves, Songs on 12 play, See you around. Every song is 
AMAZING. I wish Lady in a Glass Dress was a full song, it's just amazing. I 
LOVE IT ALL! "

"Great album Good beats, awesome lyrics, sweet music. Lost in ya Love is a lovely song. 
Breezy :) "
"he came hard and my role model ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee turn up chris 
brown is my role model to sing dance and everything he probaly had his ups 
and downs but he came much harder and he nevers stop even if people put him 
down and yea i have the same dream he had when he was 16 and he kept 
dreaming he would make it and he did so imma keep dreaming and tasting that 
i can do it .....i had tickets to see him but my mama was so sick when she 
got off dialysis so i gave my tickets away im only 11 and know whats its 
like to be put down so if you can chris brown see this pleeese look me up 
im you follower on insta and fb dont have a twiiter and promise me you will 
never ever give up on your music because i odnt never what i would doo 
:):):) P.S dont feel sorry for me feel happy "
"Excellent What I like about Chris Brown is that while he may not be the best singer, 
his creativity is on point, he has the best beats out there. He mixes up 
things, all of his songs are different. To succeed you have to take risks 
and he's not afraid to do that. "
"Disappointed A very good album in its own right but I feel its missing some florence 
charm in the previous albums with the music sounding more mainstream rather 
than quirky and brilliant in its simplicity. I miss the harp too.UPDATE: 
The more I listen the more I want to listen to lungs and ceramonials. 
Nothing stands out on this album except maybe third eye. This album sounds 
like the pierces first albumn with florence's voice over the lyrics then 
""versioned"" by Mark ronson "
"How big, how blue, how beautiful Amazing, you will not be disappointed, I loved Lungs but I think this is 
even better, this is an album I will enjoy listening to for years to come! "
"Perfect comeback Amazing. Perfect mix of big, dramatic and energetic songs and then soft, 
slow songs. You can really tell this album is from deep within Florence's 
emotions and is probably the most personal she's ever been. While it's full 
of emotion, it still doesn't stop it from being immensely fun to listen to 
and there are plenty of songs that just make you want to lose yourself and 
dance. "
"Great!!! Huge Madonna fan and am more of a pop genre, but this is so fabulous! 
Great voice, great lyrics, great songs. Only problem is I can't listen to 
it a lot because her voice is the same in every song and some songs sound 
the same. But very impressed! Been loving Madonna's new album 'Rebel Heart' 
as well! Great year for music! "
"I paid for it but can't download My phone died, bought a new one and the album shows in google play 
purchases but only offers ""free trial"" and ""listen"" as options and doesn't 
give the the option of downloading my purchase again to replace it's loss. 
Get stuffed Google play. "
"Fab fab fab ... will b listening 2 this album whilst doing my 1st race 4 
life ... "
"Flossie, isa, rob, rusty, Mark, Chris, Tom are absolute bæs ❤ Love the flo love the machine, love how big how blue how beautiful "
"Best thing ever Florence has outdone herself, showing that she doesn't just rely on 
fantasy but also does just as awesome in reality. "
"A predicted 2015 festival favourite Love this album,title track sets the bar,but Various Storms and Saints is 
my earworm.Hi 5 Flo! "
"Such a class act This album is fantastic. Best thing since London Grammar's I you wait. 
Sophisticated tunes for sophisticated listeners "
"The album is typical Florence + The Machine album: great use of diverse 
musical instruments; great vocals; and great lyrical content. "
Love ship to wreak Love it 
Only just downloaded it & already it's giving me goosebumps! 
"To excited, I bet it's good anyway "
"I love her songs Her songs always seem to get to me and there is always a song for every 
mood :) "
Great album I just wish it was available here in the U.S. 
"Bewitching It has not been released yet but I am so enticed by the whole comcept of 
this album so far. With the water and earth symbols possibly playing a part 
in HBHBHB and also the very first single What Kind Of Man is a masterpiece 
on its own I personally can not wait to be able to hear this in full. "
"How big ""this big"" How bold ""this bold"" How bloody beautiful. ..... "
Amazing Best so far.buy album.you won't be disappointed. 
It isn't out yet but I love it Yay 
"Please. I've waited so much for a good album, disappointed with this boring thing. "
"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful The title says it all, there is simply no other words to describe it. "
EmotionalLy subjective rating Phenomenal relativity to name in description validated 
Just awesome Can't wait till the day 
Fantastic! The stuff I've come to expect from Florence <3 
"Everyone shazam the title song and play it from the app.... Full song or 
snippet by the sound of it..... "
AMAZING!!!! What can i say simply worth the wait 
First time listener Wow......Amazing! 
"Perfect Again, they amaze me "
Du yt? Err yt? Rru Dr err tititri F2f u err I Dr d d t etat ituttitiy 
Over rated. Poor by the standards of the rock of the past. Avoid 
Love this Wonderful lyrics.xx 
Wot a belting voice florance has!!! Never fails to disappoint 
"*Janice voice* Oh. Mah. Gawd. Yass on every level. This album is so yass that they should rename it How 
'On Fleek, How On Point, How Yass.' "
Andrew plunkett Brilliant album

Best album ever 
Peace is the mission Epic! 
Dope! AF! 
"Not a trach that i want to skip in this album!! Luke Bryan as once again 
produced another amazing album that pushes the boundaries of all types of 
music, epically country. She got me high is now one of my personal 
favorites from luke and its a song that you just have to turn up the volume 
for. One of Luke Bryan's best albums yet!! I cant wait to here some of 
these songs from his live concerts!! "
"Luke Bryan the best country singer loving the songs spring breakdown and 
games perfect "
"Worth the wait! Proud of Luke and everything he's accomplished! Honestly I have been a HUGE fan of Luke for two years... ik that may not 
be forever but IK a lot. Its sad to think he's wrapping up his Spring Break 
shows... mostly because I had hoped that in two years when I was in college 
I would get the Luke Bryan SB experience, but I understand all good things 
must come to an end and he's had a solid run in Panama City! It kinda makes 
me wanna ""Spring Breakdown"" ;) But if you are debating on purchasing this 
album or not please, please do... I promise you WON'T regret it!! I support 
Luke and everything he does! He is not only a great artist but also an 
AMAZING person! "
"AMAZING Luke your music is amazing I love all of your music it's amazing and I 
especially love your latest album KILL THE LIGHTS "
Country At Its Best Hell yeah we need more country music! It's good for the soul:p 
"confused Why can't I like get it on my phone or listen to it when I paid.. I don't 
wanna buy that music thing "
"Not available in your country!?! I love Luke Bryan ....why is this not available in the UK!? He was here in 
concert last week? "
"Love! Love! Loved it!!! I LOVE u!!! Will u come and be my neighbor?!?! PLEASE!!!!!! 
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "
"Spring Break I get that Luke is saying goodbye to Spring break, but this CD was a huge 
disappointment. Depressing. Not one song stands out that I like. Wasted my 
money. "
"So Long I'm in love with this album as a native Panama City Beach girl. Not a 
single track that I don't like. We will surely miss you next year! "
"Glad I didn't buy it first I love Luke a lot- seeing him this summer but I'm glad I didn't pre-order 
it considering quite a few of the songs are on the last one...I'll just add 
it on Google Play. "
"Awesome This album sends you to a place where nothing can go wrong,unless you are 
inturrupted. "
Luke bryan I love all of these songs I would suggest this album if u like Luke Bryan 
"Luke Bryan Rocks I absolutely love everyone of his songs, he's got a Great voice, Great 
Stage Performance and is Wonderful to his Fans and audience! He should 
totally WIN, CAUSE HE ROCKS! I LOVE YOU LUKE "
Love U Luke I so love this album still #1 Luke Bryan love it love it good job 
"Disappointed Kind of upset that I pre ordered this before seeing the tracklist. I 
wouldn't have paid that much for only four new songs and the rest of the 
album just a rerelease of his last spring break. Meh.. "
Love Luke Bryan disappointed this is his last spring break album 
"Love Him The first time I heard luck Bryan I loves his music and I'm not a big 
country fan...but I have every song ☺ "
Luke Bryans new cd Love love love me some luck Bryan ughhh 
"Loved it Since he first started out, he's was great and still continues to be the 
best. Proud of Luke and how far he's came along the way. Keep it up "
"Catchy. Fun. Summer tunes. All these songs are perfect for this summer season. Some real beachy vibes 
to fall in love with! "
Spring Break Love every song!! Awesome CD 
"Same songs as last year's spring break Most of the songs are the same songs that were on his last year Spring 
Break album. come on Luke "
Luke Bryan I loved it!!! I hope he comes about with more 
Luke you've done it again Not a song I don't like on this album 
"Atleast he didnt,stop completely His last song I guess Imma get a ticket hopefully "
"Luke Bryan Not the one to listen to country music but I love Luke and his music ! 
He's alway so full of energy! He's amazing love the Cd "
"I love luke bryan Well worth the wait I've seen him 3 times in concert and he's great my 
wife and I love him this album is a++++++++++++ "
"Great spring break album I love Luke Bryan's spring break albums and this one is no expection with

Best country singer I love his music so much 
Awesome album luke! Another great one keep them coming 
"Checkin' Out Awesome new songs. Can't say there is one song I don't like. Very excited 
for the new spring break music. "
Luke Bryan Spring Break - Checkin' Out Love to hear Luke Bryan by far an outstanding artist 
"I love Luke Bryan. I have to admit it was disappointing that 6 of these 
songs were already released last year on his Spring Break EP. I was hoping 
for newer songs for his last Spring Break Album. "
Luke does it AGAIN!! Haven't/can't stop listening to this album!! Love it!! 
I can't pick a favorite 
Mr. Luke Bryan no one will know how to Spring Brake like you!!! 
"Dope album Lyrical genius, way better then this main stream stuff that plays on the 
radio. Sick beats, good lyrics, and awesome choruses. Been following this 
dude since his endless summer days, hope this puts him on the map. Gotta 
listen to this! "
"Amazing? I don't know how he does it, he raps about the same stuff the others do 
but better? He threw me off with I Mean It and Lotta That but Tumblr Girls 
and Opportunity Costs just hold my heart "
"FRICKEN AMAZING!! G-Eazy is a lyrical genius in his songs but mix in his sick flows and 
chorus and you've an unbeatable artist, this guy is too great and this is 
coming from a guy who NEVER reviews ANYTHING "
"I don't usually review anything, But this album is so worth the purchase. I've listened to every track and 
his flow stays sick the whole time. From start to finish, you'll feel his 
vibe. When you hear the last song, you'll be hungry for more. Opportunity 
Cost plays with your emotions and gives me goosebumps. The fact that an 
audio file can make me feel like crying blows my mind. I hope he does more 
stuff like this. Highly recommended, fan or not. "
"G-Eazy is AMAZING He can hit it anytime he wants, even tho I am male. He has outdone all 
previous works and revamped his style perfectly. I love you G-Eazy! "
"Rap? This dude is just talking to a beat really like his beats go hard but he 
is just talking on the mic. "
He's beautiful I mean it This album is so amazing. He really outdid himself. I love it man. 
"One problem. I need help. It will only let me listen to like 4 songs. The others say 
""playback error"" or ""need Internet connection"" please help. Phone is a ZTE 
Z-max 2 and album was purchased Saturday may 7th "
"All about it! Best album I've heard in a while.. Digging the story. Humble dude. Good 
things are coming! #GEazy "
"Drake wannabe Listen for yourself. It's embarrassing how shameless he is in attempting 
to recreate Drakes iconic sound. "
"Album of the Year! Cannot really say there is a single song on this album that I do not like. 
Great sound that makes you want to continuously listen to it! Although he 
has the cliche lyrics it is still such an amazing album, I would just say 
he needs to improve on that aspect but other than that this is a piece of 
art that should be recognized for its greatness! "
"Breath of fresh air!! (Very rare) At first I was skeptical of g-eazy but I listened to I mean it then got 
hooked from there! I love every song in this album (which is very very rare 
for me to like a whole album) he has a very unique style and flow and he's 
mastered it. Also the subject of his songs range from same as most rap to 
unique and cool "
"It Doesn't surprise me that he only has 1k reviews People don't know good music they judge music by covers if it's not Nicki 
Minaj, Beyonce, Lil Wayne, or Drake it's easily looked past these days. His 
music is unique and I hope sooner or later other people will notice it as 
well. "
"Recently discovered this guy. I'm really glad I found this artist. Really like his style, lyrics, and 
beats. One of a very few rap artists doing good things. "
"How is this so popular? A lot of people saying he's a lyrical genius... Are you kidding me? This 
guy raps about the same thing in EVERY SONG. Not hating this album blindly, 
I listened to a fair share of tracks from it and was blown away with how 
simplistic his lyrics are, how boring the beats are, and how so many people 
are mesmerized by this guy's weak lyrical content and delivery. Extremely 
overrated. Easily an album to pass on. "
Amazing Just gets better and better. You won't regret it absolutely amazing album. 
"One of the Best G-Eazy is easily one of the best rappers he has a monotone flow which fits 
him when he delivers lyrics. Hes always putting in work. Finally was 
appealed by his work when he droppped Must Be Nice and Endless Summer. Even 
though its the same topics as some mainstream music , its a chill vibe you 
can play over and over again , its relaxing as oppose to young moneys 
annoying yelling dj who stands around in their videos "
"Getting big I been listening to him for about a year. I just been waiting for him to 
get out there and make his music real big "
"In love Honestly best thing I've heard in a long time. Such a chill album I didn't 
want to stop listening to it but I had to work but once my break hit I 
started listening again :) amazing job can't wait to go back and see him 
again live "
"G-Eazy: These Things Happen. Every single song on this album is awesome. Worth every penny! Keep it up 
G! "
"Should be number 1 Thia is the best album ive heard all year. I have been following G for a 
while and his music is on point. Totally worth it. "
"Refreshing Great album.... I was surprised by the lyrics of this g-easy... Liked his 
humility and charisma "
"Refreshing A much needed deep breath of artistic expression of music. This is not an 
artist that looked next to him to see what the other artist was rapping 
about to copy a sound. This is a unique individual that has a great sound. 
I love it and I'm excited to see how he grows with his future projects. "
"Simply Fantastic Best rap album I think I've ever heard. It's revolutionary, fresh, and 
unique. Just awesome!!! "
"Best Album Out There This album is just too good its literally been my anthem the whole year 
and like a little bit of 2014 "
"Great Album. Best album I've heard all year. Very chill, great production. THESE THINGS 
HAPPEN! "
"listen to this and his old albums,you're gonna like them,been following him 
since his amateur songs, to endless summer,he's getting big. G-eazy all the 
way "
Amazing. An amazing artist with great range. G-Eazy is perfect. 
"G is goin to the top! Stays true to his Bay area roots and doesn't change his style in order to 
go main stream. Great music! "
"Amazing Loved it even though a little rough with the woman lyrics but that's how 
some girls are... Sad but true. "
"Absolute gold He's a genius. I highly recommend this album to anyone who's sick of the 
same old, crappy rappers. "
"Very impressed! I'm very impressed with this album, ""Been On"" and ""Opportunity Cost"" 
caught my attention then so I figured I would check out the rest of his 
tracks and I was quickly blown away. "
G you beauty!! This album is sooo sick. 
"Love this Artist He is such a great artist. My nephew ho me to listen to his music and I 
love the words he uses, the beats and his delivery. G-Eazy makes rap music 
fun again. He reminds me of Eminem when he was younger. "
These Things Happen Its an amazing album you won't regret buying it you can get Hyphy to it 
"Great Hip-hop album A new twist to the basic trendy formula that has dominated the radio. 
Worth a listen too. "
"Hijack What radio station plays this guys music? Definitely not Chicago. I 
remember this dude from the BET cipher thought the freestyle was tight but 
listening to this album after Wiz Khalifas Blacc Hollywood where he says 
people taking his style it's apparent that's what G-Easy on his rap name is 
whack his flow on this album lacks dimension and fervor where are the 
cadences what is he really talking about? I don't feel it no not at all "
Life is perfect Without G-Easy there is a good chance I could be in juvi. 
"He's f-cking amazing I normally don't like an entire album, I actually don't even like rap. But 
when my boyfriend showed me G Eazy I was hooked. I can't stop listening to 
this album and other songs he's released. Who ever said white boys can't 
rap lol jks. Anyway this album is killer. Love it!! "
"It saved my life Once I got caught in the forest and I remembered I had this album 
downloaded so I played it. My phone caught on fire and I was able to start 
a fire. The next day I was rescued, true story. "
"Excellent! Fallout Boy have returned with a rekindled fire and are set to burn up the 
competition. Although their new approach isn't quite what I was expecting, 
if they return to their original ways and construct songs on par with Dance 
Dance and Thnks Fr Tth Mmrs, they'll soar right back to the top of the 
charts. Overall, there are some good songs here, 3. has to be a step 
towards their glory days. "
"Love fall out boy always have and always will, again they've amazed and 
impressed me :D "
"I can't not give 5 stars BUT. . I love fall out boy but save rock and roll *don't hate me* is no where 
near as good as foile a deux and the songs from before the hiatus but the 
music is good "
"<3 <3 Would rate 7 billion stars out of five fall out boy has always been good 
and this album is a little different but still amazing let's all clap 
together to the sound of patrick's voice like omfg i'm going to die. "
"Great album This album is a mess, yet they somehow made it work. The songs are great 
on their own, but they don't really work as one piece, despite them being 
presented that way in the music videos. "
"Young Bloods never die big FOB fan. this album was an amazing comeback. the collabs are awesome, 
espicially with Elton John. there are some truly epic tracks here & i never 
get fed up of this album, it fits nicely with their earlier work too. saw 
them on tour with this album & genuinely pleased they're continuing to make 
awesome music!! :) "
"AMAZING I love this album so much, I don't care if the songs sound a bit similar, 
they're so amazing, these four are so talented I've loved these guys since 
forever and they just keep getting better and better, i bet 'American 
Beauty/American Psycho will be just as good too, i love the song (the album 
name) and the song 'The kids aren't alright' too keep making the awesome 
music Patrick, Pete, Joe and Andy "
Love it I have always loved Fall out boy and I love this album SO much! 
Best songs ever In love fall out boy brilliant quality 
"Amazing!!!!! Best album ever!!!! I love fall out boy, and i love a lot of there songs, but the songs on 
this r incredible!! In my opinion, best album and band ever!!!!! "
Fall out boy. REBORN! A great and fresh new album from fall out boy impressing me once again. 
"I love it I only started listening to fall out boy when this album came out now I 
love them "
"Wow Amazing album! Check out the YouTube channel all the music videos are one 
big storyline. "
"Fall Out Boy <3!! Patrick's voice is amazing, songs are powerful, simply 
love FOB!! "
"This is Fall Out Boy's best album to date, its an amazing comeback from the

skip......... FOB have none you want to skip "
