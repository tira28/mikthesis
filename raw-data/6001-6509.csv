The Cowboy Rides Away I don't have the words to say how great George Strait is. 
"Love it but... I love Eric church too, and I bet it was a dream for him to play with 
George. But honestly... This was Georges going away album. I don't think 
Eric should have been in it. "
"OMGoodness.... Amazing. I got to see him in concert in 2014 in Des Moines, IA and it was 
the 1st time I could actually see his lips move while he sang....amazing 
man & music. "
"Keith Odom Mr.Strait is a very, Blessed singer, father and husband. Talenter beyond 
words but, always down to earth kinda fella. "
"Ok Wasn't the best song selection for a going away party as big as George! 
He's got a huge list of songs but come on.... Arkansas Dave to name a 
few..... "
"Too bad for Us He's gone, but hopefully he will return. "
Vince gill sounded like a robot that could've been left out 
George Straight is the best There is no better singer then George Straight. He so handsome. 
None better It doesn't get any better than George Strait. 
"One of the BEST!!! Grew up listening to George, Merle, Willie, and the rest ( the best!) Sad 
I never got to see George in concert but gonna miss his song's for sure!! 
Such a wonderful performer and a true to life cowboy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
"Vintage Strait Sounding better than ever, George's final concert tracks are a must own! "
"King of country I love him and so dose my family and I love the song cowboys rides away no 
one can sing country like George "
"Amazing! Love this more than words can describe! He did such an awesome job with 
the set list for this last show! A must have for George fans!♡ "

"Hey Cowboy Don't stay away too long! Enjoy you free time & Thanks for many 
memories... "
Love it! Will always love this music thank you George:) 
Awesome The king of country music no doubt! Every song he ever made is a hit!! 
"A Classic Reminds me of cruising around in my cousins car back in '89. This is an 
album that crossed all boundaries and transcended all racial lines. The 
Godfathers of gangsta rap, I still listen to this album. "
"I am a huge fan of N.W.A N.W.A music is awesome, I heard most of the songs on this album, it was 
100% dope, just Fantastic, remarkable, I don't know how to explain, but 
this is amazing music "

All his music;; 
Great album Southern style.

"The beginning. This album is good. Feel this is the beginning of the end. You can tell 
this album is professionally produced. I have loved them since the first 
time I say them on the sing off. But this feels like the sell out album. 
Which is great for them but it's not just the 5 of them. The use of extra 
sound effects (reverbs and such). It's not the roots they came from and 
makes me a little disappointed. Still good and worth supporting them. Just 
feel this is the beginning of the end of 5 talented people making pure 
acapella music. "
"A Must Buy! I am just going to tell you that this is an EXCELLENT and AMAZING album! 
You must buy it and here are three points why: 1. It is Pentatonix! 2. It 
is acapella (which is amazing)! And 3. It is a lot of original work! There 
are three reasons and should you need more then you need to just buy it 
instead of over thinking it. This purchase will make you very happy, trust 
me I know from experience. "
"CANT GET ENOUGH!!!!! I've been waiting for this for a LONG time now and its everything I 
thought it would be and more!!! I just bought it today and I've played it 
through 4 times. Something about their music (covers included) strikes some 
deep, great feeling, emotions that I can resonate to this album with. I 
have been a lifetime fan since PTX Vol. 2. If you want something different 
and still phenomenal, PTX is the way to go! "
"Absolutely perfect in every way! Looked forward to this release for months, 
once it got here I started playing and haven't stopped. I can listen to 
Pentatonix all day every day and never get tired of them. They are such a 
ridiculously talented group. Scott, I love the rasp in your voice in Sing! 
Also, Kevin, can I just say....wow, loved your part too. Mitch, you're 
always spot on and fantastic and wonderful and..and..I could go on forever. 
Kirsty, Water is SO good! It's a perfect showcase of your voice. Avi, what 
can I say sir, Light in the Hallway is stunning. I love these guys so so so 
much! Can't wait for them to come back to DFW! "
"PTX in top form Over the 17 tracks there is only one that I don't absolutely love. It's 
not a perfect album but it is still fantastic! It's amazing what PTX had 
accomplished for music and a cappella. Can't sleep love and sing are 
fantastic singles, and light in the hallway is something I will be singing 
in my head constantly. This was definitely worth the wait! "
"Of course this album deserves 5 stars. Anyone who gave this album less than 
5 should be ashamed of themselves and obviously doesn't recognize the 
amazing talent they hold. Although they didn't write all the music 
themselves, they still possess more talent than a lot of other popular 
artists. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes energetic, 
upbeat music. "
"Five stars for the five stars. It's only right. I preordered this because 
of ""Can't Sleep Love"". Totally love it! The ""ahuh"" and ""yeah"" are small 
details but make the whole thing! I can't wait to hear the rest of the 
album and hope it's just as good. Ahuh! Yeah! "
"Always sl*y They are so talented! I love it! I wish they would have thrown in a tune 
or two that reminisced of Love Again or See Through. Also, some of the 
production different than anything they've done before. Some great, some 
iffy. "
"Of Course I Loved it. It's Pentatonix. You can tell it's professionally produced–I feel like it takes some of the 
clear-cut distinctness away from their sound.They sounded Raw, with their 
pure voices,and it was unbelievable.This album doesn't sound as raw,but 
it's still a beautiful. PTXVol III had more of a pop feel to it:whereas 
this album does have several peppy and fun pop songs,it seems to have more 
of a demure, hauntingly beautiful theme.Happy with my purchase.Will 
probably annoy my roommate for the next month listening only to this. :) "
"LOVE! A few years ago one of my friends could not stop blabbing about this 
amazing group of a capella singers that had won the sing off... what were 
they called? Pentatonic? Patonix? Pentatonix. I stumbled across one of 
their songs, this group that my friend kept talking about, and I fell in 
love. Looking back, I don't know what would have happened if I had never 
found that song, I would not be where I am now. I can't believe how far 
we've come! CONGRATS PENTATONIX!!! Love the new album❤ "
"Bruuuhh I honestly think you are sleep if you are not feeling this album. On the 
very first song I was here for it all!!! Love how everyone has an actual 
part, my boi Kev CRASHED If I ever fall in love. My goodness!..... Just yes 
across the board. "
"This album should be a huge success. The first single, ""Can't Sleep Love"" 
has a somewhat R & B sound to it with impressive harmonizing and rhythm. 
From the snippets of other songs on the release, like ""Rose Gold"" it should 
be a great adventure in discovering what other great music Pentatonix can 
not only sing, compose, and produce - - but write as well. I am 
anticipating the arrival of the new album with high expectations. "
"AMAZING. Pentatonix has done it again! Their voices are beautiful and their 
harmonies are amazing. I cannot stop listening to this album I'm so 
obsessed! Can I also just say that REF GOES OFF!!! YASSSSSS!!! This album 
definitley deserved that #1 spot! "
"Can't be better There are my angels. My perfect people with angel voices. They release 
album after album, and they develop only in better way! I Love Them so 
much! Such an gorgeous album ✨ "
"I think I would love it if I could get it. I woke up this morning going Yay the new album is out, and I had 
preordered it. But for some reason, it won't give it to me. I don't know 
why, but if someone could tell me, I would be happy. "
"Nothing short of amazing PTX has been my favorite group for awhile now, and I've been so pumped for 
this CD to come out! It's everything I was hoping for and more :) "
"Loved it I love the song Can't Sleep Love just in general and Pentatonix is 
amazing. It is hard for me to even put it into words. The best I've heard 
in a long time. "
"Best Album Yet Every song on the album is fantastic. I keep trying to pick a favorite, 
and it's very difficult. I've listened to this album at least once a day 
since it was released and I have yet to tire of it. "
"Can't sleep love Good on time all the time hope to get the whole album love love like to 
the people amen clear and articulate no extra let's go to back up church 
alright alright bye now100ok "
"A Masterpiece Created By God!!!!! This album is so good!!!!! Na Na Na is a good easy song for everyone, 
Can't Sleep Love is a good r&b soul song with smooth beats, Sing is a fun 
song to dance to, ref is a Pop song with great beats and lyrics, First 
Things First is soooo good that its unexplainable, Rose Gold is Fire The 
Rest Of The Album Is Sooooo Good!!!! Good Job Pentatonix!!!!!!! - Joshua 
Millage "
"They are the BAND! How can you begin to account for the ridiculous level of talent and 
prowess pouring out of this fab five?? Eshoes of the jazzy funk of Take 6, 
the pop groove of Maroon 5, with tick-tight vocal harmonies and the 
unrivaled bass of Avi - they're the X-Men of a cappella! See them live if 
you can! "
"I've followed PTX since they first became a group and I can't explain 
enough how amazing it is that they're making their own music now. I'm crazy 
in love with this album. Each an every song has me feeling something 
fantastic whenever I pop their CD in my car. I highly recommend this album 
for people of all ages! I love it! "
"Just.... Yasss!!! This album brings back ""beautiful"" and ""simple"" music. Soulful, creative 
songs that EVERYONE can enjoy. All of the member's individual personalities 
are represented throughout. Brings chills every time I hear their angelic 
voices. Pentatonix is unmatched!!! "
"Best. Group. EVER! I love these guys so much. I have a lot of songs that I love so much, its 
played on a loop 24/7! And I have a huge obsession on Mitchell himself and 
the song water. Both. Are. Bae. "
"AMAZING. The whole album is an amazing work of art. One of those albums where you 
can listen to the songs the whole way through and not skip any because 
they're all amazing. "
"Love Love Love It! I have been waiting solong for this and every song is amazing. Na na na is 
so inspirational and to the river and light in the hallway brought tears to 
my eyes "
"So great! Such talented musicians all the way around. I wonder how long long it will 
be before other artists get tired of Pentatonix improving on their 
work...Their Cheerleader blows the original out of the water (and I loved 
the original). "
"So good! I'm a new fan, but I have become such a big fan! Anybody who hasn't heard 
their stuff really should. So much skill! "
"Something New This album has things that they've never done before. Every song is either 
really fun to jam to or sing passionately with. The vocals are amazing and 
the compositions are creative. "
"LOVE the new album! Love the album, every song! Can't say enough good things. I play every 
track, it's the soundtrack I listen to at work on repeat. "
"Perfect Pentatonix Album! I have the cd for this album and play it ALL the time! I'm talking 
cranked, no headphones, singing along. Slow songs, power songs, great 
lyrics and amazing vocals with their famous signature vocal rythm section. 
You need to buy this! "
"Amazing album from Pentatonix! : ) Love this album & love them & their music, amazing harmonies and voices, 
love it! <3 definitely recommend this album if you love Pentatonix and if 
you are a fan of acapella! : ) love the new singles, Can't Sleep Love & 
Sing! <3 "
"I absolutely love this album. I've always loved PTX and this album is the 
best so far. Mitch, Kirstie, and Avi all kill their songs. Scott is 
fabulous as always. It's just absolutely amazing. "
"Love it!!! its so good, their sound is amazing and they are truly my inspiration. 
sounds really cliche but I love it "
"Best album by far! Pentatonix have always been talented and this album have exceeded my 
expectations. I've had the whole thing on repeat from day 1 of release! "
"BEST BAND EVER I somehow only discovered Pentatonix over the summer, and I'm so glad I 
did! I never really listened to A Capella, but I realized how incredible it 
is. They are so talented and the lyrics are beautiful. This album is 
constantly playing on my phone. "
"SO AMAZING Most talent I have seen ever so big artists get out of the way for them, 
this goes for every one of them "
"Obsessed I just can't get enough. I am new to the Pentatonix fandom and kicking 
myself that it took so long to give them a listen. "
"PTX is the best!!! I am obsessed with this album! I can't stop listening to it, I'm so proud 
of how far they have come. I am and always will be a pentaholic! "
Kill me noww I already know this thlrack Is finna be popping 
"Awesome!!! Follows in the typical perfection of all her (their) work!!! (On a side 
note... Before you try and be a ""keyboard Ninja"" make sure you're 100% 
correct.. Otherwise you just look.. Well, since this probably isn't the 1st 
time, you know what ""idiocracy"" looks like.. You just have to lift your 
other finger.. C'mon I know you can do it.. & scroll down and/or look 
around because Bartender is available as a single... But, I'm sure they 
made it available because they were scared.... DOLT!!) "
"Lady A Forever! I first heard this at a IHeart Radio concert with Lady Antebellum and fell 
in love with this album. If you like country and pop music, listen to this! "
"Bartener I have never seen my hubby dance, been together for 15 yrs. this song 
cames on. He's up & dancing it's fun to watch "
"Awesome album It sounds like something changed on this as far as their style on this 
album, but whatever happened made it awesome. Long stretch of love and 747 
are the best songs on there. And of course bartender. "
"Dumb What's with Bartender not being available as a single. Pretty arrogant. 
How about I not buy any of your songs or albums. "
"Falling for you Been waiting for this album for a very long time and love the new album. 
You guys are my favorite country band out there you never seem to 
disappoint me. :) "
"Hey Bartender I literally love this song. It is so amazing. I love the perfect harmony 
that Lady Antebellum produces and it's just amazing. "
"Its all good Lady A hasn't put out nothing that wasn't good. I always said they were 
great and it just keeps on coming. "
"Greatest Fan! I say them on yesterday's show of GMA and heard about the story behind the 
title for the album and it was incredible. I have loved Lady Antebellum for 
a very long time and this album is truly remarkable! :-) "
"Great album I haven't heard a bad song from them yet. Love the guitar work 
on this album AMAZING!!!! "

"Leaving album on repeat! I loved the direction Lady Antebellum took with this album, each song 
better than the last. Their blend and artistry is at the top of their game 
for this album, folks! "
"Amazing group Seen lady a in concert 3 weeks ago best show I've seen in a long time. 
Hope to see them again "
"Worst of their albums. It is like it was time for another album to be 
released and they threw this together. I listened to it once which will be 
my last time, "
Desieving Why advertise 99p when £10.49 I do like it but way to expensive 
"YUP! That's a good album This is by far my favorite album thus far. Love the new songs and sound. 
747 written by Gordie Sampson is just awesome! "
"LADY Antebellum747 Deluxe Great mix of songs; Love falling for you on deluxe edition . Never heard 
Song I didnt love by this group ! "
"I'm hooked Bit late to the party but im here now what a great album ill be sure to 
play it for all "

"I can't stop listening!!!!! I love Lady A and I love their new album! They just get better and

LARS SKIIPOLE YER A FUD

Lady A Usually make solid music do always a swell choice 
Great album One of the best albums they have ever made. They just keep getting better! 
Falling for you I liked it a lot the words was something great to. 
"747 A mix of country and pop that gets your head bobbin and your toes tappin

"Haven't bought it yet but can't wait! I love the songs on this album. I can't imagine not having more from the

Deluxe lady antebellum Anazing live them 
"I love the album I really love the song bartender the most out of the album but all of them 
are really good "
Bartender I could listen to this all day and night and it just makes me happy :) 
Can me hi Juileann Miller 
AWESOME I love every song...another great album from Lady A! 
"Great Work The production of the album sound effects and beats are just great + 
Tech's flow and lyricism make this album really dope. 24 tracks many 
features but mostly on hooks. Its not a cheap album, but its all worth it I 
dont really skip any songs on this Album "
"An Ever Ascendancy Just keep doing what you do man! Let the mass corruption, infectious greed 
and delusions of self-proclamatory entitlement spread relentlessly, just 
like the cataclysmic fire that'll inevitability end the very empire that 
provided the spark. "
"6688846993 Tech is hands down untouchable compared to all these trash rappers. I can 
barely stand turning on the radio anymore the garbage spewing out of it 
makes my ears bleed. Keep the real s*** comin tech, but keep those industry 
goofies off your songs they aint f****n with strange music! I'd love to see 
another collab with scarface rittz jarren benton or eminem. "
"First off all did you notice the fact that the album cover is bas ackwards? 
(The 9 is on the other side 4 the slow...) The whole album was phenomenal. 
A G with true feelings (heart)...I salute you for that. Technicians 
forever! "
"Shut up and take my money!!!! I don't have it but I know it's hot and now that I listen Speedom (Wwc2) 
I'm done I'm buying this S**t.... "
"It's impossible for Tech to make bad music. Every album is different with 
different tones, themes, sounds, even the style of music. This album is 
amazing! I've had it on repeat. There's not one song that I dislike on this 
album. There's no song by Tech at all that I dislike! "
"Can't Stop (^S^) Music Proud to be part of the Tech N9ne experience for 10+ yrs now... Technician 
I am, wholeheartedly In life, and, in death... "
"Off the chain Could have been shorter cause he gets it done easily with ten eleven 
tracks. I'm not a longtime fan but this is the best I've heard from him. "
"Best tech n9ne album yet Got it thinking I would listen to it throughout the week, no no no listen 
to the whole thing in one sitting it was amazing it is a must by even if 
you don't like rap it was amazing "
"Special effects This tech nine dude is so overrated it makes me sick .he just yells and 
has guest spots to pick up his lack of lyrics and annoying voice "
"His best yet This album is probably my new personal favorite Tech album. It has so much 
heart and such a great variety of genres. Gangster, EDM, heavy metal, old 
school rock, old school rap, new school rap, pop. It's such an incredibly 
well put together album that deserves a listen. "
"Great album! After hearing speedom I had to get this ! Haven't heard a song yet that I 
don't wanna hear again... all 24 of the songs are perfect! "
"Quality Music Not his best but still that same ""A+"" quality and authenticity I've come 
to expect from Tech. Good work homie "
"Wtf The last half of the album is dope as hell but the first half of the album 
is mainstream as hell. From speedom to the end is real rap and Tech in his 
element but it's just an ok LP. LOVE STORY BLOW THIS PUT THE WATER SORRY 
TECH. "
"the weakest part of this album is the features this album could be amazing but some of the featured artists bring the 
quality down. But the beats are amazing, a very well produced pic of art "
"Best Tech Yet Probably the most ambitious album by tech yet. But I can't help but feel 
the big singles such as ""hood go crazy"" are out of place in this semi 
depressing/ up lifting project. This album takes on a concept of techs 
personal life were as other projects by him have been more hit based so to 
say. I somehow get the feeling that tech just recorded a bunch of songs and 
edited them to fit together. I know I'm just being critical but besides 
these comments I really enjoyed this LP "
"He's a rap God Eminem who's on this album Tech n9ne is the world's biggest underground independent label maker the 
realest rapper in the rap game besides Eminem.. challenge Jay Z Challenge 
Kanye West we're supposed to be at the top .....and neither one of them 
will respond or challenge him back cuz is no competition he wins "
"The best out there I hate rap/ hip hop but whenever there is a Tech album out I buy. Omg he 
is a lyrical master! Great album!!! "
"Censored I know I would rate the album 5/5 however I purchased the explicit version 
and all the songs are censored please help!... *edit* it's all sorted now 
6688846993 "
"Finally, this is beast The new special effects alblum was totally worth every penny this is dope. "
"Another amazing album The 3 singles I've heard so far are all amazing, the speedom snippet was a 
great teaser, I'm fully excited for special effects. "
"Falling off? Not the same tech he used to be. Highly disappointed in this album. And 
Speedom should be more of a Midwest choppers 3 than a wwc2. "
"TECH N9NE!!! Tremendous work of art, should absolutely be in running for the album of 
the year, but probably won't recieve the recognition it deserves because 
its Tech. Every song is amazing. Such a variety of songs presented in their 
own way. Terrific overall album, a masterpiece. STRAAAAAANGE MUSIC "
Going to be great album Tech hasnt disapointed me yet so i doubt he will now 
"Just crazy The most unique album I've ever heard with collaboration of very talented 
hip hop artists. Purchasing this album is worth it "
"This album is buff! Just heard the whole album and it's toyt like a toyga. PB3 is my fav out 
of all 3 PB's. Tech is runnin strong right now. "
"Best Album Ever! I been a Tech fan from 2010. Tech never disappoints and he certainly didnt 
here. This is way better than the radio and anybody you've ever heard. 
TECHNICIAN I AM, WHOLEHEARTEDLY, IN LIFE, AND IN DEATH!!! STRANGE MUSIC!!! 
All the features were good, and this album is personal and deep, and I cant 
choose a favorite song. 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 out of 1. Buy It!!! "
"Tech N9ne is the greatest 25 songs guaranteed to all be bangers every single one! I've heard 4 or 5 
tracks so far my two favorites are On the bible feat T.I. And Speedom(WWC2) 
feat Krizz and EMINEM!!!! This studio album is more star studded than the 
grammys well worth the money "
"After making $8 million last year... As an Independent artist who made Forbes list last year Tech N9ne finally 
gets his just due. I think this is like Tech's 15th album & arguably his 
Best work to date with collabos from Eminem, Hopsin, Krizz Kaliko & a ton 
more.. Don't Sleep! R.I.P. to Tech's Mother who recently passed. "
"Dwamn I can say to me Tech should be number 1. Love everything he comes out 
with. "
Too pumped up!! Just too hyped man!!! Strange Music for life!!!! 
"Collaboration crazy dope ! He don't need anyone to be sick....they need him....I'm buying this sick 
album. He gets better every year. "
"Great album! Tech killed it in all of the songs Just like he usually does. Glad eminem 
joined him! "
"Phenomenal Great project from Tech, the most aggressive he's sounded in years, which 
to me, aggressive Tech = Best Tech, if I had to describe the album by 
comparing to his other projects, it's almost like a hybrid of A6A7 and KOD, 
it catchy and widely appealing like A6A7, but topically manages to go dark 
and brooding like KOD. "
"Beast Mode best collaboration album to date from tech in my opinion I will be buying 
this album twice keep it going up ^$^ "
Best album of the year If you haven't gotten the album you're wrong.. get it today 
"Good album. Not as good as Yelawolf, but very good. Still getting into it. 
Beats seem to put me In a good mood. "
Was expecting bit better. Was thinking it would be better tbh and have fragile on but didn't. 
"Just wow. Best of Tech yet. Moving. Pain makes grate music, even my mom likes a 
couple of tracks. "
"Tech is number 1 Tech is the only artist whose albums I will pre order, every song is 
awesome so I know I'm going to like what I get. No need to sample his songs 
before I buy them! "
"That's when I knew!! Just finished listening to the deluxe album and that's when I knew I loved 
Reba even more favorite country singer out there great job on the album I 
love it! "
Country Music I really love her music. She is a great country singing. 
Love it I love every single song on the album 
Love it! Love this album. Amazing job from an amazing woman! ♡♡♡ 
Reba McEntire love somebody 
INCREDIBLE 
"huge hit this year! Does this play a sample before you buy it? if i buy it and it stops short 
like it has i will never buy anymore and delete this app. My sin passed 
away in a truck accident& this was his fav song. He sang it while he worked 
or was even just happy any time of the year. Now i hear his voice when i 
hear this song :) "
"Love you guys ! HAPPY HOLIDAYS My favs! Aw, love these guys. They are never short of perfection. Could 
definitely see myself listening to this long after the holidays. :) 
Pentafans 4 life! <3 Supahfruit! "
"PRXmas Awesome, fantastic, brilliant. I mean, there are a lot of words out there, 
from such a small combination of twenty-six letters, that I could use to 
describe this album. Instead I'll just say this: Thank you! x 1000 "
"Carol of the Bells When I first heard this song, I thought is was ok. When I heard these guys 
do it, I stinkin fell in LOVE!! I love love LOVE PTX!!!! If you dont like 
them, youre psycho! "
":( Fantastic group. However extremely frustrating that ive purchased and can 
only listen to it via 'play music' app. Cant actually store to my phone, or 
organize it into a file with other songs. Please fix. "
"To Brenda Morris I'm sorry for your loss but to answer your question about the sample, yes 
they just play you a sample but when you buy it you get the full song. 
Enjoy "
"Annoying setup I only actually wanted one song, but to get it I had to purchase 
everything twice, both individually, and as a whole album. This annoyed me 
to no end, and now I want to spend the money on other things, and I can't 
get a refund. "
"PTXmas Love a capella groups since I first heard Don't Worry, Be Happy. This 
caught my ear and being a sap for great old traditional Christmas music I 
just had to have it. Love the vocal ranges. This group does excellent 
covers of great pop songs like Royals and Radioactive also. Such talent!!! "
"Pentatonix is the best acapella group in decades; their voices blend 
beautifully together and they perform with the depth of a large musical 
group and a band put together, but with only five members. Amazing! "
"I love you guys. You guys should do call your girlfriend by Robyn. I love you guys keep 
singing!! I will be buying you Xmas album! Everybody look on yuptube and 
subscribe them. They rock! "
"Best thing Ever LOVE ESPECIALLY LITTLE DRUMMER BOY !!!!! OMG THIS GETS ME IN THE SPIRIT 
AND EVERYONE THAT HERE'S ME PLAYING IT "
"I love it KEVIN IS THE BEST!! AND LITTLE DRUMMER BOY IS AMAZING!!! ITS BETTER WITH 
PTX SINGIN IT "
"Totally Awesome It is amazing and awesome to listen to. Very soothing after a long 
stressful day in the operating room. "
"I love this!! One of the best acapela groups I've heard since ""the real group"" You guys 
are amazing!! "
"Amazing Wow! Such and awesome group! Very talentes. Every sound you hear is done 
with a voice...my favorite group of all time!!!!! "
Absolutely amazing I'm just addicted to Pentatonix!! 
Blown away How come I JUST discovered them. They are awesome 
Excellent I love them best group and best version of the drummer boy ever made. 
Parental pleaser Finally have Christmas music that doesn't just drive me crazy. 
Pentatonix Pure talent. My new obsession. 
"I love ptx so much thank you for this great album I love it... I'm away 
from my family for Christmas but your music makes me feel closer to them 
...thankyou "
Not available to All Access subscribers. Very disappointing. 
This group is awesome. I am addicted Must buy 
"Amazing This group is absolutely amazing! I just discovered them a couple of weeks 
ago and I'm loving them. "
Amazing! This is one that will be an annual favorite at my house. 
"Loved it:-) Little drummer boy is my moms favorite christmas song,we would be driving 
to school and my mom would start singing the song. Good times. "
Love it My only complaint as a group.. Not enough of you yet! 
"AMAZING LITTLE DRUMMER BOY i LOVE them they are amazing i can never stop listening to the little 
drummer boy! "
Better and better They never cease to amaze 
"I love pentatonix, they are amazing. Definitely my favorite group ever. And 
this album just gets you in the Christmas spirit. "
"Amazing One of the best groups ive heard in a long time. My 17mth old is 
mesmermized everytime we listen to them. "

"Such a stellar group!!! I've loved them ever since I saw them on THE SING-OFF!!! They're a special 
group of singers, and an excellent group of musicians!!! Love them...no 
matter what they sing!!!!! :-) "
PTXmas (Deluxe) Rating Wow loved their 1st Christmas album the 2nd is on it's way! 
"They are AMAZING!!!! No words can describe the happiness these 5 beautiful souls bring to my 
life. "
"It's OK Not better than the original. Great lyrical content overall matched 
unfortunately with garbage hooks. Game tries too hard to shape his music 
into today's ""modern"" style and it just doesn't fit. Save maybe 4 or 5 
tracks, song replayability is also very low. "
"Fire fire This album is gonna contend with doc1 as his best work its amazing not a 
weak moment on it. Yes I got the leak but still copping the album. Read 
wiki for disc 2 and it has a few tracks listed. The features are amazing on 
it. This keeps the west going after TPAB and Compton Doc 2 continues the 
west winning. For me doctors advocate was my Fav game album til now. Doc2 
does not disappoint you can tell it was not rushed at all.some of his past 
albums have had filler and that rushed feeling well not Doc2 GET IT "
"Hip Hop Album of The Year Real music!!! I can't get through the album because I keep putting every 
song on repeat. Game most definitely did his thing. His producers brought 
some hot beats. His featuring artists are prefect. "
"Great Album So far! This has Got to be Games most ambitiou album to date! Better than The 
Documentary or The Doctors Advocate? Definetly not, for one, those albums 
are nostalgia central and are really banging albums! In order for this 
album to be better than the first. We'd have to wait 10 years to see if 
well be still listening to this one like we still do The Documentary. But 
definetly no songs better than Hate It Or Love It, How We Do, Higher, Put 
You On The Game, Dreams, Where I'm From. Great album regardless. "
"Ughh If your a fan of the classic that is the documentary 1 dont listen to this 
it sounds like every other album out now. Alot of hype for a big 
disappointment "
"I can't even explain This album is ridiculiously dope. And the transition between songs are 
just icing on the cake, I've never listened to an album where they continue 
the song to the next one. "
"Know its good but doesn't work Listened to the tracks on YouTube really liked it so thought I would 
download. But only saying playback error and won't work? Anyone know how to 
help? "
"Double disc!!! 2 disc released in back to back weeks. Know this is gonna be dope. Hes 
only dissapointed once with Year of The Wolf know he coming back hard. "
"I'm one of the biggest game fan this sucks He should go ahead and retire the last good album he had was lax. It 
sounds like a gangbanger mixtape and their first time rapping 
disappointed... OKE was off the chain tho should of made that the album "
"No good. Can the game make a CD with substance. Cussing and violence dont sell for 
me. It takes away. If asked. I know he can do better please "
"Wow If you like all this bubble gum ssst like say migos? Fetty wap? Future 
mumbling? I can keep going but yeah, don't buy this. If you like REAL hip 
hop, get this album. "
"Got the physical and digital Game's Doc 2 is the dopest album this year. Finally game going hard again. 
Only gripe is too many features. But he outshines almost everyone 
lyrically. Dope album. "
"DON'T TRIP ON IT!!!! Definitely fuckin with it that joint him and Ye did was all around lyrics 
on point too and thats what i look for when it comes to hip hip PERIOD!!!! 
So when it comes down to it i can admit its a great piece of work and with 
the next album dropping so quickly im maaaaddd curious right now sounds 
like a comeback "
"Man... I wasn't even a Game fan previously, but THIS is by far one of his 
best bodies of work. Well produced, written and relevant to today. His 
features were well did but most importantly, Documentary 2.0 I can play 
straight through without skipping, except some of the skits, I skip those, 
but the songs, they got it! I normally stream music, this was an album I 
purchased, last albums I purchased were Kendrick Lamar, J.Cole, and Dr. 
Dre. "
"No real hip hop icons left out here supplying us with the fix we need. 
Solute to the game on this new albulm. Hip hop is Definitely still 
breathing thanks to a few. "
"That 100 I Play Errday A Must *Miss Big Twan That Waz My Real Ngga If He 
WaS Still Alive He Wud Kill Nggaz* He Kilt It Wit Tha Samplez Kendrick Verse On Me Oh My "
"I give it 5 nutz out of 5 It's a break from all the Trap music/Gay Agenda music you here in rap now 
a day's... Good Ol Compton "
"The Game Delivers I've listened to The Game since his debut and it was great to see him 
deliver once again. This is a very unique album in my opinion. It has a 
good mix of old school and new school. I appreciate that Game kept this 
album gangsta and authentic. "
"Nice ""Just another day"" is excellent! I've been waiting for a while on doc 2 
many songs are really good and comparable to Dr Dres ""compton"" or ""Dotox"" 
album. Really nice stuff here some song are excellent others could have 
some improvements. "
"Label? Music has changed and if you're creative and nurture your talent, the 
people will buy your music. Great lyrical content, don't come with that 
booboo, maybe voodoo, become a lyrical guru, who knew but you, it's just a 
Game. "
Game outdid himself This is a certified classic album. This was everything I wanted it to be 
"Alright This album he sounds angry he's being disrespectful regarding his 
children's mother and some other women I mean that's his choice but where 
lies your talent??? The violence and anger ruins the tone of the album if 
that's the direction he was intending on shooting for he nailed it... "
"Thorough! As an Inglewood native and old hip hop head its rare to find a hip hop 
album with more than just a few good tracks nowadays. But Game delivers 
with this one from beat production to his elevated flow, and even his 
artfully selected guest features. Wish that hip-rock ""Hashtag"" joint was 
longer Game, but the whole album is classic! "
"Dope The Documentary is his best...BEST album yet. Listen all the way through. 
No need to keep your hands by the skip button. Old school feel. Amazing 
samples. Can't wait for the second disc "
El Chapo This goes so hard. Exactly what hip hop needed. 
"Ready!!! Three years of hard work and dedication on this album. Couple push backs 
but he did it so that we'd get nothing less than great from this project. 
October 9th and 16th shall be a good day (in my Ice Cube voice)! "
"Finally!!!! Been waiting all week for this album and he didn't disappoint me. Unlike 
the last few albums, this album is filled with track after track of pure 
fire lyrics on cocaine beats, and the features! Omg the features! Kanye, 
Drake, kendrick and Q-tip. FIRE!!!! "
"ALBUM IS FIRE Love every song on this album. I have never liked every song in no album 
from any artist until now. "
"Alredy a classic! I can just tell it has that feeling to it. Just remember 
10 years from now. Listening to ""100"" and this whole album deff gonna bring 
me back ! Best hip hop album this year "
"Wow way better then red album and jesus peice And better then that compilation year of the wolf ..classic album .alot of 
work put into this dope album ..this and dre compton album both classic 
.the west is back running the rap game ..big up game ..salute .....where 
disc 2 pre order at ? Album drops in 5 days "
"this album is tight!!! the game dug deep for this and came up with 
platinum!!! and the second disc (2.5) is even better!!! DOPENESS "
"Grade: B++ (Favorite Tracks: Don't Trip; Dollar And A Dream; Made In 
America; Circles; The Documentary // Least Favorite: B*tch, You Ain't Sh!t) This album was great. "
What hip hop should be. None of that new garbage fetty crap type of rap. Pure. 
"Classic I gotta say this album is one of the best by far i can play this whole 
thing through im happy that someone still know what rap is it's a good year 
with Dr. Dre, The Game, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole. I personally went 
looking for this album on CD as well cuz it ain't a classic unless you have 
it on a CD lol "
"Its real, but Its real but it just doesn't sound good in my opinion. Can't find one song 
I like. "
"This is a trow back to the old game Very happy with this album the game is on point,a lot of references to his 
1st album if you listen..don't trip,the documentary 2,hash tag,sum of my 
favourites at the moment but the whole album is a grate pice of work from 
the game.in my opinion the original documentary won't be beat as it's in my 
top 5 all time albums but it's a grate album none the less "
"Solid Album Double Disc I THINK THIS IS A POSTIVE STEP TOWARDS GAME GETTING HIS SWAGGER BACK FROM 
THE FIRST DOCUMENTARY ALBUM AND DOCTOR'S ADVOCATE RECORD, I LIKED LAX AND 
THE RED ALBUM. THIS IS MORE OF GROWN MAN MUSIC GREAT SOUND AND GREAT 
LYRICS! "
"The realest album released in years. Compared to what is coming out this 
days i can say it is classic. A lot of people talk that it aint like the 
Documentary 1, but it shouldn't be like it in 1st place. I mean an artist 
was at one place mentally at that time and now 10 years after that he is on 
other place and it is a following of the 1st album. If an artist is in the 
same place for 10 years it only mean he didn't evolve. This album is DOPE 
from the 1st to the last song. "
"Best album yet! This is what hip hop should be. Lyrically amazing. Interscope obviously 
was cramping your style. "
"Not the best. He said it's as good on the original but I don't think it is. Sounds more 
old school. "
"Album is great NO STARS TO GOOGLE PLAY MUSIC, BC I HAVE 58 gigs left in storage ON MY 
PHONE, and when i try to download this for offline use it tells me, NOT 
ENOUGH MEMORY WHEN IT CLEARLY SAYS THE STORAGE AMOUNT. SO I JUST BOUGHT 
SOMETHING I CAN ONLY LISTEN TO VIA INTERNET? if i wanted to do that its 
called youtube. Why do yall do stuff like that? Always trying to nickel and 
dime people to death. "
"BO$$ LADY LOVE this album, He did an excellent job on this one! Ryan Cassidy? You 
are crazy this is his best album he has made...just my opinion. He will 
continue to suceed with his music. HATERS PLEASE fall back! LOL ~BO$$ LADY "
"So what yall saying I moved to BR in 08 i was in the 6th grade when he was local doing his 
thing with the single im a grinder that when i first heard him, i wasn't 
really listening to southern hip hop but after hearing him really spit i 
was hooked. Lucas brasi is my favorite mixtape by him "
"Bulls eye .....on time delivery. ... clear direct and a Lil fresh new flow to the 
ears. .. .. but don't take my advice Cuz with all the new rap ....I I go 
beats first .. flow ... and then I pay attention to lyrics "
"Beastly Album Really has a distinct style that stands apart from other current rappers. 
Best songs gotta be Perfect Imperfection and John Gotti. Despite some of 
the negative comments on here, this album is definitely worth it. "
"Love this man and his music. In order to really understand him you had to 
go through the same things he did. I relate a lot to him. I've been 
listening to gates since 2004. I'm very supportive of him. #bwa #idgt "
"Luca Brasi 2 I love Luca Brasi 1 and By Any Means so I know I'll love this too I 
already love the songs he's already put out #Salute to Kevin Gates I love 
this man he's educated,smart,great father,and a genius "
"Kevin Gates is the best rapper that came up. You already know I gotta preorder this. This dude has not made a bad song 
yet. Kevin speaks from his heart. That's why I love his music. Bruh, I 
don't get tired. I get it out the mud, bruh bruh. "
"GATES Great music really good i think its better then the first Luca brasi and 
for the haters that say he's wack you just don't know music and go listen 
to some one else if u don't like him don't come on here and complain 
because he's one of the greatest artist out there right now so go choke. "
"I think Gates is definitely one of the greats. He's a trail blazer in hip 
hop. As a Louisiana artist also I know for a fact the best rappers are in 
Louisiana . This guy is another example of how southern rap will forever 
run this considering our diversity and contribution we provide to the game. 
It's getting hard to ignore this type of skill. Gates is one of the greats 
period. "
"That work Doing work all over with a masters degree while he was in prison. Gates 
knows his business & does it well. This IS A MIXTAPE mind you haha. Keep it 
100. #IDGT #DBMOD "
"Word Around Town ft. Rich Homie Quan Luca Brasi (Intro) ft. Starillio Makin

"My man got me hooked He always played it in the car, I had to steal it from him haha -sit down 
& plugs daughter- my ish! "
Kevin Gates is soft He's just a bad as young thug 
"Gates is a beast Name one person who goes harder than gates . loved Luca brasi 1 & 2. Gates 
took off so fast "
My son nice uall must not listen to lyrics. Hating azz cros 
"Lucinda Bowie, first you way of, how you going to say he needs to read a 
dictionary when your what 25 yet you can't type the entire word. Second, 
this man is a gangsta, and no I'm not talking about that ""Ima gangsta 
because I'm fly bullshit"" i mean gangsta as in running dope across the 
inner city streets. I don't know this man's struggles, but we from the same 
part of the bottom and thats Southside Baton Rouge, a spot where you 
wouldn't last 15 minutes without getting turned. So what what you say. "
"Don't no what everyone talking about this fool sick came from no where and 
now shaking the whole music industry other than the unrecognized tech 
n9ne... "
"Mrs.Gates I Loveee It.! Kevin Gates Is Baeee.! So if course I had to get it , Just 
call me The Plug's Daughter "
"Great Album Brasi No doubt kevin gates still blazing hard with every song in this 
album.always going hard with every single lyrics he spits on his mixtapes. "
"Str8 knowledge This dude spitting the hottest bars right now. real street nigga, i got 
all his mix tapes. "
"LB2 I'm n love with everything about this guy. He's perfect in his 
imperfections. Music is soul touching "
"Perfect Imperfection Worthy of a #Salute!!!! THERE ARE STILL REAL ARTIST THAT TALK REAL LIFE 
ISH AND NOT JUST PERPETRATING....#VoiceOfThaStreet "
"I would usually find a way to download music for free, but not for this 
dude. Well worth every cent I'm going to spend for his music. "
"Better than mainstream Gates is the best underground artist. I have this from datpiff and bought 
it when it came here. It's worth it "
"plug daughter It about sums up my life story I can't explain how much i connect to this 
artist and his music "
"Great album! Great lyricist!! I am an 80's baby. So I am use to listening to the pioneers of rap, were 
lyrics and good beats mattered. Kevin gates in my opinion, is already one 
of the greats. He is the an example of a creative artist. He blends 
together multiple genres so easily. You get some gangsta flows and beats, 
R&B, conscious rap, and down south flow. Hopefully he gets the recognition 
he deserves. #KevinGates#IDontGetTired #GarbageRappersFallBack "
"B.R Representin that B.R. ,cant nobody f@$!k wit baton rouge rappers. "
"It's tight I love everything about it... And when my parents tell me to go to bed I 
sing this song "
"Gates For those who's saying Kevin gates is African American, listen to the 
beginning of ""Plug Daughter"" he clearly states that he is Puerto Rican. Not 
black. "
Keep it up because we don't get tired. My favorite artists in the game right now and by far the realest 
I Dont Get Tired More great music from the realest rapper out there 
"KG go so hard,and I know ima like this album,didn't know much about Kevin 
Gates until I was incarcerated,and been listening to him ever since,big ups 
to Kevin,and a shout out to all my hoods and hoodlums,soowoo "
Too Too Hot!! This is going the hardest out there right now. 
"LUCA BRASI 2 I can't wait til dis b***h hurry up and f****n drop gates my f****n n***a 
I f***s wit dis n***a LOUISIANA AKA DA M****F****N BOOT TIL DA CASKET DROP "
"T H I S I S R A P This guy has worked for everything and his rap is true and about what's 
really going on THANK U KG "
"Remez Brown kevin gates is the best rapper I ever listen to because he tells the truth 
he is not scared of nothing at all "
Long live Brasi Kevin gates has been nice now everyone will finally see #IDGT 
"Bruh... This CD is pretty good, I never really heard any of his music until #IDGT 
came out then I went to go hear the album before purchasing and I must say 
I really like the whole album. "
gates do his thang he dnt bullshit Louisiana's finest Shid rap game finest 
"What has hip hop come to? Just says half the things over and over and talks about same things. How 
can people like this?. "
"The end of hip hop! Are people really listening to this recycled rubbish!, he raps about the 
same subject matter, from track to track. This is poor material! "
"Disgusting Awful. Terrible. Disgraceful. Especially compared to Mastermind. Was 
expecting great and was bitterly disappointed. Worst album. "
The production is really good! Rozay did his thing as usual too 
Terrible Listen to port of Miami or Trilla if you like Ross. Not this 
Boss Love the song heavy weight before boxing matches and training 
Rich B*tch Money flows

This is hard 
So bad 
Excited! 
Dope 
perfect !! 
"Her Voice is Everything I know artists don't like being compared to others, but she sounds like 
Adele but with Christian lyrics and I LOVE it!! She doesn't have the 
generic Christian music sound that's so common. She has raw talent and 
emotion in her music. Can't wait for this album and more to follow!! "
"How Can It Be, First I love her music, great vocals and lyrics. These two songs spoke to me and 
my life the most. I discovered her perusing Christian music videos on 
YouTube last year. And to watch her sing How Can It Be, absolutely touched 
my heart. "
"Heartfelt Praise Powerful and True Her genuine and amazing voice will move you to tears. The lyrics decribe 
so many feelings and emotions we go through in our daily walk. Great music! "
"Love her voice! Lauren Daigle has a beautiful alto voice that's rare.* Trust in You * is 
my favorite right now. It's a powerful message to help you through those 
rough times. "
"Fantastic album! The whole album is great. Her voice is terrific and the songs are awesome, 
meaningful, and relevant. My favorites are 1, 2, 5, 7, and 11, but there 
isn't a single song on the album I don't care for or dislike. This is the 
first time I'm downloading an entire album! "
"Amazing! Gotta buy it! She sings the song of God's very heart and knows how to draw in her 
listeners to make peace with God and give the message that God hopes 
someone will deliever to His people. I love hearing her passionate voice 
sing songs that can't help but draw believers draw in. "
"GREAT She is truly blessed from God with her voice! Her whole album is so heart 
felt an Jesus CHRIST Presences near so strongly an has you want to sing an 
pour out to God cause the words she has in the song speak to you in many 
ways an is powerful! Thank you Lauren for you music an sharing it to our 
all brothers An sisters! God bless you! "
"Excellent Album and Worship! I recommend it! The Track called ""First"" 
captures The essential Truth of God's Word! Matthew 6:33 To Seek First the 
Kingdom of GOD and His Righteousness! When we prioritize to Always put GOD 
First, everything else will workout beautifully! Delight in GOD and He will 
Delight in You! :-) "
"Incredible album! Wow. Lauren's voice is simply amazing. Listened to one track, and then 
bought her album. Hopefully I will get to see her live one day. "
"Amazing! Absolutely beautiful voice! I love her song ""First"", the first time I 
heard it on 104.9 Positive Life Radio, I immediately feel in love with the 
song and definitely reminded me to put God first! "
"There all awesome. You should get all of the songs, they really reached my heart. Get them 
Jud saying. "
"Lauren daigle Am I the only one that thinks it is utterly sad to hear a ""Christian"" 
singer blatantly copy a secular artist as if she can't have her own God 
given style? I do believe we are not to conform to the pattern of this 
world.... I think it's stupid...and pitiful. "
"Great jazzy voice It's SO great to hear a voice like Adele, without the trash, just 
pleasant, lyrics that keep your eyes & mind on Him, pleasant voice, easy 
listening, gentle on the ears, great sing-a-long car music* it's worth it "
"Love her style of singing .. ""Trust in you"" is awesome ,""First ""is amazing. ""How can it be"" brilliant . 
Laurens song's will bring you through battles ... An You Will Win the 
War!!!! "
"Uplifting I'm hooked, as this was my first time listening to this artist, this album 
blessed my soul and spirit. To God be the Glory for the things he has done! "
"Loving it I love Lauren Daigle's music. She is a great singer. If you don't know 
what Christian artist to listen to the start here "
"All Great songs speaks of what we all go through in our daily lives and words

"GREAT! Its realy good first. And trust in younis the best if you like it i 
recomend He Riens by news boys. "
"Phenomenal Album Zedd really knocked it out of the park for his sophomore album. Every 
single track is a unique masterpiece in their own right but listening to 
the album as a whole is simply a work of art. There's a little bit of 
everything in this record: from club hits like I Want You to Know, to the 
grittier track Transmission, to melodic tracks like Daisy there is simply 
something for everyone. This album is surly a hit to old and new Zedd fans 
alike. Standout tracks are Straight Into the Fire, Papercut, and Illusion. "
"True Colors is amazing I've been a fan of Zedd's work since Clarity and let me tell you that this 
album is better. Every song is a color and you can clearly tell because 
every song sounds different from the last (some even bleed into each other) 
and sure this may be a little less ""hardcore"" for some people but I love 
how his electronic music could also be acoustic or orchestral and still 
have the same effect. This album has a story to tell and it's effective and 
inspiring. You're missing out if you don't buy at least 1 song. "
"simply awesome! i never really listened to zedd before, but when i read a few reviews and 
recommendations by friends, i thought i might listen into this album. 
luckily, i'm on google play music all-access, so i could listen to every 
song without purchasing it. but now that i've heard every song, i'm happy 
to say that this album is definitely worth its money! especially the songs 
addicted to a memory, beautiful now and papercut are catchy. i will 
definitely purchase the album when i stock up my google balance the next 
time! "
"A new side to Zedd This album is terrific. Zedd really put a lot of time and effort to make 
this alb different than what we've seen him make in the past, and I'm 
totally fine with that. He's my current favorite DJ right now, and most of 
the songs on this album just remind me why I like his music so much. "
"Heaven This album is amazing! Its rare when I like every song in an album. I'm 
trying not to listen to it to much because I don't want it to get annoying. 
Fantastic album by Zedd though, hope he keeps it up and doesn't release 
another album for a while! "
"HIGHLY COMPLEX pieces such as Addicted To Memories is the reason why Zedd 
is a stance apart from other mixers. Papercut is another excellent track 
from emerging super star vocalist/actor Troye Sivan (you are moving nowhere 
but up, up, up boy!) "
"Killin' it This is a fantastic album. Zedd has killed it yet it again and brought a 
lot of new sounds and vibes in. Some particular favorites/recommendations 
are Papercut (Troye Sivan's vocals are ethereal), Straight Into The Fire, 
Illusion, and Transmission. "
"It was Ard but not better than clarity It's just this album didn't do things & produce that amazing energy that 
""clarity"" did especially since none of the songs were just beats put 
together which was disappointing, the album is creative but I didn't enjoy 
it that much, but it was better than that Calvin Harris ""motion"" BS. I 
honestly don't know if zedd will ever out do ""clarity""! "
"Crazy I thought it would be pretty hard to top ""clarity"". Zedd basically just 
obliterated that thought with one song. He then proceeds to absolutely 
murder anything I've heard over the year by other artists. And it isn't 
like it's just one song that did way better, it's the WHOLE ALBUM. Props to 
my favorite artist. The wait was totally worth it. "
"Outstanding Never have I bought an album where I've LOVED every single song until now. 
Zedd is so talented and his music is really diverse, whether you're into 
EDM or not, you're bound to like this. "
"I Am In Love I say this about every type of music but I am in LOVE! I was just looking 
up Troye Sivan, and it said that he was gonna be on Zedd's newest album. I 
was only excited for tgat, but when I heard Beautiful Now, Addicted To A 
Memory and I Want You To Know, I was actually for real looking forward to 
thus album. Now that I've heard the whole thing, I am in love. 
LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE. "
"PAPERCUT FT TROYE SIVAN I honestly was blown away at how good this song in particular was. it 
might seem biased because I'm a huge fan of troye already but it was stuck 
in my head for a whole week and the song is so catchy. Great job guys <3 "
"Entirely overproduced This album certainly has a zedd feel and sound to it but it's as if it's 
zedd on steroids. The sheer quantity of different sounds and beats as well 
as the abundance of lyrics on some of the tracks is almost repulsing. On 
songs like true colors (empire state building) the vocals are in the same 
chord for almost 2 minutes and addicted to a memory probably has over 100 
different beats/sounds to it... it literally sounds like a dial up modem. 
Beautiful now is amazing though and I have mad respect for Zedd . "
"Worth The Wait Zedd's first album Clarity restored my faith in EDM, and as soon as i 
heard that, I was itching immediately for his next album. The wait pained 
me for so long. As i was just starting to move into other genres of music, 
I thought to myself ""why dont I check up on how that Zedd guy is doing"" 
right on the release date of this new album True Colors... He's really 
something different, and even though this album doesn't follow the familiar 
path of his first. I have huge faith in this artist for the future to set a 
new definition for EDM. All i need to see next is a Zedd/Myon & Shane54 
collaboration, and my life will be completed "
"Self explanatory Do I really need to explain why this album made by one of the best DJ'S 
ever gets five stars... I think not Keep bringing the amazing life changing 
experience zedd we love you! "
"Zedd does it again Zedd brought me into EDM and he is still the best. This album is simply 
amazing and really makes you feel great and that you can do anything. I 
recommend it whether you like electronic music or not because it is more 
than that. Good job Zedd and keep up the beautiful work. "
"Best album ever First piece of music that I have legitimately bought, and I am not 
disappointed! I've always loved Zedd since he first came on the scene and 
this album is amazing, every single song in it is fantastic. Definitely 
worth it! ☺ "
"Its OK and here's why... Zedd is one of the most influential artists in my music career but I feel 
like the flare and passion of his first album clarity was not carried over 
into his second one. spectrum (my favorite zedd song) has a immaculate 
arrangement of vocals, breakdown, buildup and drops and had so much passion 
and effort put toward it and I just don't feel it this time not 
disappointed, but underwhelmed and tbh I like the dancier tracks when it 
comes to electronic music so not a fan of the album, but I have lots of 
respect "
"Zedd hasn't changed Zedd has kept true to his style, not giving into the new edm-pop nonsense 
that has been circulating through the radio. This album is phenomenal! "
"To start I thought this album was so far below his original at first. These songs 
and the way they hit your ears can make so many dark moments better. Well 
as I don't think this surpassed the previous entirely I do think this album 
is truly amazing. "
"ZEDD, but not dead Saw the concert in Phoenix... Kicked azz.. "
"Amazing once again with True Colors The one who truly bring me into EDM . Every song made for any mood. Never 
a let down. Each different in their own way. Simply amazing. Anton is the 
best out there, and Let the days count on to his success. Love it Only wish 
to see one of his spectacular shows "
"Speechless!! Honestly Zedd never disappoints! his songs all connect it feels like he's 
telling us a story through music and its so amazing "
"Brilliant When it came out, I was impressed with the new sound Zedd had produced. 
This album is way more successful than his last one. The song I really 
liked the most was Papercut. My favorite on this album is Bumble Bee. True 
Colors is one of the best Dance Pop albums ever. "
"Zedd is Amazing!!! Zedd got me into EDM... Especially with my favorite song, find you, but 
now his new album Came out and its OVerwhelming!!!!. . .my favorite song on 
the album is papercut.. . . keep up the amazing talent, Zedd. "
"Fantastic! Zedd is such a talented artist, this album does not disappoint in the 
slightest. Gems like True Colors, Papercut, Illusion, and Done With Love 
make up for any shortcomings on the album there may be. Very Pleased! "
"Utterly Amazing No words in the universe can truly describe how amazing this album is. I 
had no doubts in my soul about this album and Zedd just continues to be 
extrodinary. Love his music and this album is extremely extrodinary. He is 
never a let down. "
"PAPERCUT TROYE SIVAN MELLET I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. PAPERCUT IS SO GOOD THE WHOLE 
ALBUM IS SO GOOD AND I JUST LOVE YOU SO MUCH I MIGHT CRY I'M SO PROUD TROYE 
BOY "
"Amazing I've waited 2 years to hear the follow up to clarity. You can hear the 
original Zedd in this album,but also the new Zedd. All around this album is 
fantastic. I can't stop listening to ""Done With Love"" and ""Beautiful Now"" "
Favorite Album I love every song on this album! Can't possibly recommend it any more! 
"Truly AMAZING!! It's very rare for me to like every single on one album but this album is 
one of the very few albums that somehow manages to do that. I also like how 
some of the songs are binded together so they cab play with no gap in 
between. "
"Zedd nailed it... To be honest, this is one of the most best albums out there. Zedd didn't 
just include EDM, but he also included pop songs like for example; 'True 
Colors' and 'Daisy'. This album is excellent for relaxing, its worth buying 
it. "
"Awesome!! Makes me want to dance, especially straight into the fire,done with love, 
papercut, addicted to a memory and last but not least, i want you to know "
"Love it! Zedd did good on this one, reminds me of the last album a little, but I 
like this one better. "
Nothing new Kinda boring without much soul. Talented guy though. 
"Emotional I believe this album has a lot of stories behind every song it bc maybe 
each color represents that song and an emotion I would love to meet Zedd bc 
he seems like a very cool and interesting guy "
"Can always count on zedd Been listening to zedd way back when he got picked up by skrillex I've 
always loved his music. I bought clarity and it looks like I'm buying this 
as well "
"Inspiring I'm the other hand of RAGE-ING-X and I've been trying to find my lyrics 
for songs and this album with its drops/vocals have just changed my 
perspective "
"Might have a lot of promise His last album was exceptionally good. So far from the songs he has 
released I can tell this album has a lot of promise. Can't wait to listen 
to it later tonight. EDIT: this album was everything I was expecting. "
True Colors I couldn't stop playing done with love. I just had to buy the whole album 
"TOO DOPE. A very complete album that will get you going. Mac progresses and 
change in every album/mixtape and I will always appreciate what he has to 
offer. From KIDS to Watching Movies to Faces, he can relate to so many 
teenagers out there, and that is what makes him unique. The struggle to 
overcome the mind and the environment we are stuck in, we are not alone. "
"Incredible. This could easily be album of the year. The album has meaning, it shows 
what Mac's been going through. If you're a Mac fan you'll love this. ""Jump"" 
""Weekend"" ""Ascension"" ""Perfect Circle/ God Speed"" are just some of the 
amazing tracks on this album. I highly recommend listening to the second 
part of ""Perfect Circle/God Speed"" Mac says some deep stuff in the second 
part that'll make you say ""Wow"". You don't want to miss this masterpiece! "
"One of his best. Mac really surprised me with this album. One of his best no doubt. But i 
can feel that he's just going to rise from this, and make even better 
albums from here on out. Lyrical genius that keeps you entertained and in 
tune. Try listening to Ascension, Rush Hour, Perfect Circle/Godspeed, and 
Time Flies. Great album all around. "
"Just ok. Expected a little growth from him. Loved watching movies but this doesn't 
have the wittiness, humor, or depth of his previous two. Without that, he's 
just another rapper talking about money and hoes. You've heard it all 
before. "
"One of the best 2015 This album is dope asf, probably don't listen to like 2 songs but 
everything else Is good, personally the ones that really grabbed my 
attention a lot and loved was ""weekend"" and ""jump"" I can jamm to them all 
day "
"Flawless album! Mac has officially evolved into one of the best rappers in the game(from 
listening to Nike's On My Feet & the whole K.I.D.S mixtape when it was out, 
he has always been one of the greats.) And this change since Faces or even 
Watching Movies With The Sound Off, is ultimately for the better. If you 
haven't bought this album, shame on you because this album is one of the 
greatest releases this year! No words can describe the excitement I had for 
this album and I was never disappointed by any song on GO:OD AM. "
"Best Mac Miller thus far This album is hard to overplay. I've listened to primarily just this album 
ever since it was released. I saw him perform most of it at Red Rocks on 
Halloween. Everyone needs to hear this album. "
"Good AlbuM But absolutely crap features like Cheef Kief.....you have to be kidding. 
He has ZERO content. Get a drum kit! F**K your auto electric clicks. My 
only complaints. "
"ohmagawd I've been a pretty big Mac fan since KIDS and Blue Slide Park, and let me 
just say, this is his best album to date. It just keeps delivering, the 
beats, the ryhmes, the flow, the production. Personal favs : Rush Hour, 
Brand Name, Break the Law) All of it is great. Definitely for fans, and 
people just trying to get into something new. "
"pumped popularity to sell this dude is horrible. how does a record company put out a horrible 
production. maybe record producing is cheaper nowadays and all that is 
really needed is a laptop and a shower curtain to press a cd... "
"Not even half as good as his early stuff If you liked his early stuff (Donald Trump, Blue Slide Park, Party on 5th 
Ave, Smile Back, Missed Calls ect.) This ain't it. This is more, ""I do 
drugs and break the law, I'm a gangster look at me"" than the fun feeling of 
his early songs. "
"Wtf Google play?? It's a great album however... I bought it but it doesn't show up in my 
music and when I press listen in Google play it gives me an error! Come on 
google. Don't steal my money. I just want to listen to the album that I 
PAID for. "
"Can't wait! Mac is my all time favorite rapper. His flows are sick he also knows how 
to get a crowd going! Most dope for life "
"Pretty good, but what happened? I've loved Mac pretty much since he first started out. I've always like 
his songs that are upbeat and so lively, but now he's starting to mellow 
out his songs and they just aren't as appealing anymore. He's still an 
amazing artist but I wish he'd start doing songs like he used to. "
"Made in a few hours I used to love mac's music, but it sounds like complete crap, it was 
painful listening to no joke. He has good rhymes, but no rhythm, and the 
beats he used sound like they just whipped them up, and he rapped and 
recorded on the spot. Do not recommend this. Not even for 99 cents. Come on 
Mac, if your going to put out music put effort behind it. "
"Break the law I didn't get the album, but i got break the law, the best song i have 
heard yet!! "
"Most Dope! Took a while since he dropped an album. People been sleeping on Mac and 
may have forgot how good this MC is. Straight up! "
"Mac Miller has taken a turn for the better, his music has grown as he has 
and rather than the days of ""Donald Trump"" and ""Knock Knock"" the songs on 
this album actually appear to be message driven rather than simple 
celebratory music. "
"Much improved album, brand new Mac This album sounds amazing and offers a more cheerier outlook after the 
drug riddled sound of his mixtape “faces "". They are both good projects in 
their own rights and both represent a more mature, adult Mac Miller. Great 
uptempo beats, bars for days, and decent features place G0:0D AM in my top 
3 albums of 2015 "
"Amazing Everything that I would expect from Mac. He's not trying to change the 
world like Kendrick or jcole but that's OK some times you just wanna listen 
to bangers and the message doesn't matter "
"Mac Miller has certainly come a long way Mac Miller is able to actually convey a message without changing a ton to 
the way his music sounds overall (Looking at you, Kendrick). I used to 
absolutely hate his music, but these last 3 years have been good for him. 
Glad to see him evolve as an artist. "
.... Sonically not impressed Lyrics sound fresh out of rehab. It to early to be mediocre Mac! 
"Wtf google BEWARE, both versions of the album on here are radio edited, very very 
frustrating. Otherwise, great album, best of his career IMO. "
"Best This is probably one of the best album of the year. Mad props to Mac 
Miller. Waited awhile and came out with something that would slay. "
"Can't wait! Alot of people sleep on Mac. Most Dope foreal. Straight Savage on the Mic. 
A Real MC "
"Trash Where is this fire everyone is talking about? This is still better than 
Lil Wayne though "
"Not horrible Not really a mac Miller fan bought it since it was 99￠ but its not 
terrible "
"Great Ay I love this album but you know what's funny I didn't have to pay 
anything thanks to my friends at frostwire that is an app where you could 
get one song for free or the whole album. I still support Mac Miller but I 
just wanted to say you don't have to pay money to hear the music "
"Fire mac just went up a notch in my book. Evolution of mac is hands down the 
best out of all the artists. "
"Mac Miller never disappoints Album is fire. I wasn't sure what I was gonna get when I bought this album 
because I never previewed any of the tracks. I needed some new music and 
this definitely fulfilled my needs. From ""Brand Name"" to ""When In Rome"" 
this piece of Macs mind will wake you up. "
"Lol Not a fan of his, but to the person who said he copied the Yelawolf album 
cover: if I'm not mistaken, there was a wolf on that cover, not a picture 
of Mac Miller. "
"WHAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR Been listening to mac all my life and have been evolving to him as he 
moves on in life. Faces and GO:OD AM are the masterpieces of our 
generation. Don't sleep on the new yeezy! "
"Very well done album From the lyrics, beats, to the concept this album is very well put 
together. You can nearly play it all the way through without skips. It is a 
little too long of an album, but almost all the songs deserve to be there 
outside of maybe 2 tracks. "
"Yup Bout time a perfect album from him. Not theowing shade at the other ones 
but this is def a part of hiphop history and the fact nobody could ever 
compare him to anybody "
"Crazy! This Album is too good. This just solidified him in my Top 10, and proved 
his ability in the music industry. If this is his sober work, then we have 
a lot to look forward to. This is better than his last, and i'm an official 
fan. "
"In Love. I honestly can not, I mean CAN NOT, wait. Literally 2 more hours, I am 
sooo hype!! "
"I feel like this album isn't Mac. I feel like he's trying to be someone 
else. It's just not him.. His older albums are unique but this one is just 
like all the other rappers out there .. the same. "
"Can't Wait I can not wait for, this release macs been my favorite. Since K.I.D.S so I 
already, know this is gonna be. "
"Most dope!! This album is my euphoria!!! Thank you Mac miller the day I first heard 
this album my life turned around!!! Much love!! Peace. "
"So nice HAD TO BUY IT TWICE Hey it's the first album I've bought in years and the first album I've 
bought TWICE. Love supporting this guy, can't wait to see him live next 
Wednesday. Keep the positivity coming "
