"Best Comeback Ever!!! Brian Johnson took the reins, & never looked back! AC/DC hardly missed a 
beat after the unfortunate demise of Bon Scott. "
"Best songs ever but I don't like how it is not in my music app like all my 
other songs "
"Riding on the highway to hell with a little bit of rosie. one of the 
greatest rock bands of all time. "
"Brings back memories My older brother gave me the cassette version for Christmas when it was 
released. I was like 9 years-old when i got it. Still love the songs! 
Thanks bro!! "
"Back in black AC/DC's greatest ablum too date awesome rock n roll at its best best band 
never "
AC/DC totally awesome Ive been big fan of AC/DC of all their work ! Keep Rocking on AC/DC 
"The Very Best AC/DC! This is the absolute best album AC/DC ever put out! If you them, then 
you've got to have this album in your collection! "
"OI M9 SHREK LISTENS TO THIS ALBUM AND APPROVES OF IT HIS LAYERS SEEM TO 
REGENERATE FASTER WHEN HE LISTENS TO THIS 8/8 M9 "
Back in black One of rocks all time classics and great tribute to bon Scott 
Awesome! One of the best albums ever by one of the best bands ever Rock On!!!! 
"Haven't even listened yet, but it's James Taylor. So...five stars. "
"Nothing Earth shattering here, but this is a solid album. Pros: - New James 
Taylor music - Nothing too new (not a departure from the classic James 
style). Evokes good memories. - At least a 3 songs which are infinitely 
singable and/or whimsical enough to bear repeated listenings - Sting and Yo 
Yo Ma actually make good additions/contributions without being either 
irrelevant or overwhelming . Cons: - He sounds old and that makes me sad. 
He has definitely lost some diction over the years. - Nothing too new (not 
a departure from the classic James style). Leaves you wishing for something 
a little more. Summary: If you are a James Taylor fan, definitely worth it. 
This album brings on nostalgia like no one's business while still giving 
something to which you can listen. If you are not a JT fan and Tanglewood 
isn't your scene, this might not be the best place to start your 
infatuation with a great artist. "
"Huge fan After seeing James Taylor on Jimmy Fallon show, I had to get the album. 
Love his music. True big fan. "
June 16th couldn't have come fast enough. Love listening to your new songs. 
"Before this world Brilliant JT Album x James is still the best singer /songwriter of our 
time x love you and your music james best of Irish luck to you x "
J TAYLOR Before the World Wonderful James 
J. T. What's not to like? 
James is struggling here. I expect better from him. 
Still great songs Sceptical but wasn't disappointed. 
"Angels On Fenway I also leave in Western Massachusetts and I love to go to Fenway park. 
This song is very close to my heart. I love my Home State. "
James taylor Best voice ever 
"Big fan of James Taylor, but... ...some songs aren't necessarily ""catchy."" Despite that, those same songs 
tell a story worth listening to. "
James Taylor is truely a great musician! 
THE MAN IS UNSTOPABLE 
Before This World Amazing album. Love every note. 
Well worth waiting for 
THE BEST 
Love JT 
Fenway Angeles 
Before this world 
"Fake and unoriginal ""artist"" I've heard it a hundred times before. She's hiding her Australian accent 
and trying to sound like a black american rapper which is a shame because 
she could've brought something refreshing to the table but no....just 
reheated junk "
"Boo This is crap. From the first song too the last. If this is her best. 
Please send her back to the outback with crocodile Dun De. Izzy Izzy your 
crap your crap. "
The best thing since sliced bread An amazing artist in many ways.looking forward to hearing more from her 
"Liked it. Iggy Azalea is the best rapper in the world. Her singing is okay I guess, 
but not quite as good, so I rate it 4 stars because of the singing!. "
"This is a joke Sounds like a Australia's got talent contestant who is trying to be an 
American. If you like rap avoid. If you have no taste in music fill you 
boots "
"-_- I like Work and CYL but the rest is rather awful, only cost me 99p and I 
feel like i paid too much (also i love Ellie Goulding part in heavy crown) "
"I didn't find it that bad I suppose but she is a really good rapper that is 
why I rated 4 stars "
"Meh Only like 2 songs from the whole album and that's just because of the 
catchy tunes. "
"Nice stuff Had a few good songs with some nice rap so I was Gonna get them but then 
decided it was cheaper to just get the album wasn't sure if it was worth it 
listened to it more and it is "
"I Love Iggy Azalea I Have Only Heard 2 Songs From This Album Reclassified But I Guess It Will 
Be Awesome As The New Classic That's Why I Am Giving This Five Stars 
Because It Will Be Awesome From The 2 Songs I Have Heard (Iggy SZN & Beg 
For It) "
"Just as good as Nicki manaj or even better i can tell you that, Australia 
represent!! "
"I luv Iggy no matter how many times I listen to it I always wonder how she 
creates epic music "
"Love it! I love Fancy, Trouble, Beg For It and Black Widow "
"Best! U guys, enough of the racism. Just enjoy the music! If thats what her 
singing voice is then so be it. U cant change her voice!!! "
"Chazz 1st off i love this girl I'm not just saying this because she's so hot but 
this is the best album the chic has nothing but great songs cant wait to 
see her :) "
"awesomeness real rap i love her song trouble it is soo cool and i like fancy, black widow, 
change your life and beg for it you are awesome IGGY "
"Awful I don't get it. I think the only skill this girl possesses is to sound as 
if she's black. She's stolen her style from eve. In fact she is 100% 
imitating eve. Urgh be original love. "
"Stop the hating Guys stop the hating she Is great you guys have no good taste in music or 
any taste "
The best rapper from Australia. I lov u iggy . 
"I like iggy I enjoy her album but I wonder why she sings likes she's not 
Australian..... Shame "
"My God no iggy you could be so God like!! Fancy sounds like a Dj mustard 
record, and the rest could have been better. Waste of talent, you could be 
great! "
Stop complaining mnh. . If you can't sing just listing and shut DA f**k up 
Love it I am a big fan of iggy azalea 
Brilliant! Not one bad song. 
Best Love it because it is my favourite song 
Loved it This is one of the best albums 
Love Iggy and this album So muuchhh lovess for this album and Iggy 
"Ain't too bad but ain't good. Couple of tunes okay but the rest is crap. Wouldn't kick it out of bed 
though "
She's a wannabe! Horrible music Horrific. Nothing else to say 
LOVE IT I love iggy and her raps and I just ♥ ♡ her so much !!!!!! #thebestrapper 
Steals song from Kendrick and can't even rhyme 
"Original, and like nothing I have heard in decades "
ITS IGGY SZN ♡ Just amazing! ❤ 
The only person that you need to listen to. 
It's OK because I don't like many of her songs but I love her.☺ 
Oz chick who's living the dream. X 
:} This is soooooooooo bae love it go Iggy!!!! so good 
Iggy kills it!! Lovvee iggy she needs to go on tour sooon! 
Cool song love it zoo much 
"you're Australian, be Australian!' Sounds like an over-the-top American cartoon. Stronger American accent 
than an actual American's, so cringe-worthy to listen to. "
"Audible Art! This is not an album for the casual music fan. This is a graduate course 
where Professor Micheal Eugene Archer recaps nearly a century of music 
history in original masterpieces. Using religion, politics, sex, love, and 
race as templates to showcase the value of ""dead"" forms of music (funk, 
rock, quartet gospel, even showtunes). The lyrics are deeply thought out 
without trying to be deep in some ""hey look how poetic I am"" kinda of 
writing style. I could write an entire essay on this album and I just 
might! "
"Part 2 of the album Voodoo This dude came back like he never left! Music in it's purest form. People 
please understand that his vocals are low ON PURPOSE. That's why he 
released a lyric book right after his album dropped. He was conveying 
messages that he wanted you to look up and read. I gotta give it 5 stars. D 
is in beast mode on this one. I dare anyone to play the whole album Voodoo 
then play this whole album behind it. It's like you're listening to part 2 
of Voodoo only he never released the songs until now. HOTNESS D! "
"Classic on its own terms Black Messiah is not like Voodoo but just like its predecessor it stands 
alone....The music is funky and still has an old school 70' s feel.. Aint 
that Easy, Sugah Daddy. Real LOVE and my favorite Another Life all examples 
of good soulful music...I admit you will have to repeat the album several 
times and even look up lyrics but the album will grow on you. In a world 
where almost everything we hear is commercial and slick we need to some 
music that makes you take notice...album will be nominated for Grammy "
"Almost perfect. Nothing wrong with the songs at all, other than the fact that the way most 
are mixed. It's a bit harder to hear D'Angelo's voice clearly like on 
Voodo, but I fault the mixing/mastering engineer than D'Angelo. Overall, 
he's back!! The music seems new and fresh, and groovy and familiar all at 
the same time. ""Really Love"" is my jam though. I had that on repeat about 
10 or 12 times. Outstanding return to form D'Angelo. Your music was surely 
missed. Can't want for the next one. "
"Absolutely Incredible Musicianship!!! Album blows my mind...never heard anything like it. Quite like my father 
describing the first time he heard Marvin Gaye really do his own thing! 
D'angelo and the Vanguard really make you feel each vocal and instrument. 
Listen on hq speakers btw "
"Dope Album is crazy. If u dig ""neo soul"" then this is one u definitely cannot 
miss. Complaints about the sound are simply a result him not using digital 
but instead recording on 2 inch tape… this is what gives it that old school 
gritty true soulful sound, its just we arent used to hearing it anymore. 
Super Dope, welcome back D. Welcome back. "
"Dangerously close to Voodoo. The man is back! And he brought real music back with him. It's been almost 
15 years since voodoo dropped and it left me and so many wanting more soul 
from Mr d'angelo. This album brings a familiar voice with quite a new sound 
but still reminiscent of D from back in the days. For me.. Voodoo is still 
my all time favorite album. A masterpiece. Black Messiah is a close second 
with brown sugar. If yall want real music and been longing for it for so 
long.. Wait no more. It's here. "
"Back with a vengeance The best album of 2015. Deep and murky and full of soul. Yes it's clear 
he's still obsessed with Prince (that's a plus) because this sounds like 
Parade in its production. But that lp happens to be Princes best 
production. Enough about Prince. D'Angelo has been gone for a decade and 
came back on top of R&B.Besides Badu and Miguel no one comes close to 
touching this.Every single song is perfect.Aint that easy is the most 
perfect though :-) "
"Repeat champion Does my heart good to see that D hasn't missed a step musically & 
artistically. It's like he won the chip & never left the court, still in 
the zone. Game 6 flu game ish!!! "
"Instant classic If everyone else's albums were. this good, I'd wait 14 years for theirs, 
too. It's clear D'Angelo wanted to make a lasting statement of the 
struggle, and he did so in a way nobody else could. Credit due to 
Questlove, Q-Tip, Kendra Foster, Pino Palladino and everyone else working 
behind the scenes to bring this to the world. But especially thank you to 
D'Angelo for allowing us all to bear witness. "
"Black Messiah I thought real music and musicianship had died...I was wrong. This album 
is funkier than three day old sweaty sweat socks and sweeter than honey. 
Welcome back D'Angelo, I will be in the front row when you come to Chicago! "
"If You cant say something positive I've read some of the reviews and i have to say. This is not a time to 
give bad reviews to any of the artists that we know are better than this BS 
out here today. The Album is Needed and i like it for the music not the 
production. I didn't judge this as a engineer. I just loved to see him back 
after listening to music with no soul for the past few years. With no radio 
play for anyone like this we need to big up this return and leave the 
criticism for pop stars. Thanks D Welcome back we love you. "
"Masterpiece I was half sleep and heard Really Love playing on WBLS in NY. I actually 
got up and went to the.playlist to find out who it was. Then I listened to 
snipets of the whole album. Was blown away. A guitarist myself this album 
is some raw funk. A mix between Prince and gifted gospel singer Tonex is 
the nearest but then again hard to classify. A CLASSIC to me. And I don't 
go around writing reviews. Julian Shamir Green NY. "
"Funk to a Fault Sounds like a bunch of confusion. True D'Angelo will still hear his sound 
at the heart of these noisy and chaotic melodies, but not enough of it to 
make you satisfied with his return. Really Love is the only audibly 
pleasing song on this LP. The return of D'Angelo is an even bigger 
disappointment than the return of Lauryn Hill (Live). Where have our R&B 
Heroes & Heroines gone? "
"Classic Music I am blown away by this new release! It is real R&B music that takes you 
on an introspective soul journey. Go online for a lyric sheet. My favorite 
songs are Sugah Daddy and Another Life. "
"Dee Chaney.. Another Life......hit me right in the soul!!... Yeah, there are some 
tracks I can do without but overall, I am happy to see a brother back in 
the game!!! I already have my favs so cant wait for the tour!! "
"Perfect timing for Black Messiah album This album can't listen to on cheap ear buds, or lame computer speakers. 
You need a quality sound system or headphones might have to use an 
equalizer too or will believe this album is poorly mixed. This album 
reminds of back in the day when your in a smoky dim light lounge with a 
band and great vocalist. They were in the moment had fun no rules just 
authentic unapologetic soulful jams. Artists are supposed to take you on a 
journey and out of your comfort zone. Music nowadays plays it too safe and 
chases the radio. It supposed to be other way around shake things up plus 
stay true to yourself. This is what the music industry needs. Feels like 
perfect holiday gift plus way to start the new year. "
"14 Years later.... Only reason I'm not 5 staring it is because i can't understand half of 
what he's saying. Lest it's mixed purposely like There's a Riot goin On and 
Exile On Main St in which one has to employ their treble/eq to bring out 
high end to hear lyrics, but i did that and it helped...a little bit. 
Otherwise he didn't disappoint. I was SO worried that the wait would be a 
bust, but no, it's a solid lp. Now I'm wondering why he took so long, and 
hopefully he won't do it again. "
"Too long awaited I think it's time for some of his type flavor this type of soul is dying. 
Beautiful ballads with really love & betray my heart but he loses a lot of 
his voice with the arrangements & mixes in this album. Still on top of his 
game with the lay off but if he want to stay relevant bless us with more 
with less time between albums. "
"Return of the Real Music Black Messiah is like the slow, simmered home cook meal you would get at 
your grandmother's house-a huge welcome from the ""fast-food"" music we've 
been spoon fed for so many years! Welcome back D'angelo "
"Awesome Bday Gift to Me!! D has done it again with this infectiously addictive album..beautifully 
arranged and exquisitely well put together! He woke up the dead of R&B with 
this one here!! And it came out on my birthday lol well done D'Angelo!! 
#VAAllDay #BlackMessiah "
"Great Body of work This is a great body of work. Most importantly it's feel good and 
conscious messages are present. Yes the vocals are low, but I almost feel 
like this is deliberate. He's allowed the vocals blend into the groves of 
the song. There are definitely some similarities with Voodoo here, so 
anybody trying to make an excuse for vocals, as to why they 'hate' this 
album are simply trying to downplay good music. Where living in a different 
time an age now, where there is allot of 'fake hype', but it just feels so 
relevant and classic at the same time. I think it just had to happen, we 
needed it. Very few artists now, are been able to create quality music on 
this level, but I feel like this album has or can be 'the icebreaker' to 
innovation in what has become a very stagnant and elitist music industry. 5 
for effort! "
"Inaudible I couldn't wait for this album to drop, now I wish he had spent more time 
on it. If it wasn't for sugah daddy I would say the whole thing was a 
waisted effort. Sorry D'angelo this album is a miss! "
"Well worth the wait This album is perfect. I get lost in the music. It literally seems to make 
my body move. Beautifully Funky album!!! "
"D'Angelo is an exceptional Artist! This album is just as good as ""Brown sugar"" & ""Voodoo"". My favorite songs 
right now are Another Life, Really Love & Betray my Heart. D'Angelo keep up 
the good work! I am a fan for life.... "
"Only In My Opinion!!! As much as I love him & his music. I can't understand 
any words nor can I relate. And there are a lot of Prince samples. Yet I'm 
a true fan and love love Love his music! "
"D...I love you & you can do no wrong in my eyes but... This album wasn't it for me. I'd much rather here his sensually melodic 
voice over a mellow beat rather than straining to hear him over purposeful 
chaos. My opinion. "
"D'Angelo-Black Messiah Chile I know you been gone for over 10 yes but when you said you was gonna 
bring it I didn't know you meant like this.. Lawda have mercy!! "
"Album of the year! Poignant, soulful messages buried in appallingly complex sonic textures. 
Few albums are capable of being timeless and and timely all at once but 
Black Messiah feels effortlessly classic, immediate, and prescient. A 
masterstroke when we needed it most. "
"Worth the wait! Solid! Not as cohesive as Voodoo but like Voodoo it can be played end to 
end no filler, and you'll be hitting rewind again! Oh, the last track 
""another life"" freaking incredible! "
"Prince wannabe Even in his hey day you could hear the Prince overtones in his music, in 
fact when I heard his hit ""how does it feel"" I swore it was Prince. I 
recently saw D'Angelo perform on some show and you can REALLY see (in his 
mind)...he thinks he's Prince lol...wearing long trench coats, bandanna's 
on his head, playing a guitar and his mannerisms lol...all 
Prince-izims...old Prince-izims at that lol "
"Love D'Angelo BEEN A FAN FOR THE LONGEST. I'm glad that his music and his sound has not 
changed. That was my only worry but he's consistent with this album "
"DID THE DAM THING! THIS is REAL music! I'll admit, I was concerned that he might have been 
gone too long...BUT, he came back STRONG! Now, when I say ""REAL"" music, I 
mean, THAT is where the attention to this album is! Bravo! ""Lyrics hard to 
hear""?? So what!! It's the MUSIC!!! Something the industry has been MISSING 
for some time now! Masterful album D'Angelo, you did the DAM thing! "
"The Best Album 2014 Hands down this album puts a lot of artist to shame. It's been 14yrs since 
the last album and now another masterpiece. WOW!!!!!! Only one holding in 
down for VA and R&B. "
"I don't know what the hell this is Everyone is praising this album as genius, and I just don't get it. It's 
disjointed and sounds more like he's experimenting than making music. 
Cannot groove to this at all! "
"Hated It I'm sorry but what the h... happen to him.He wait that long for that.Come 
on now he could have done better. "
"This was a second a listen album. I was not impressed at first, I think 
partially due to my own aversion to anything I deem as overhyped...Now I 
have been playing it nonstop!! I am a huge D'Angelo fan and this is a 
breath of fresh air for R&B. Black Messiah lives up to, and beyond the 
hype. This is truly a very timely classic. Thank you D'Angelo for sharing 
your world with us! "
"Amazing Awesome! I've always been a fan of D'Angelo! I expected to hear greatness 
as soon as I found out he dropped a new Album! I hope he does not make us 
wait another 1000 years...that's what it felt like! "
"Sorely Disappointed Firstly, let me establish that I'm a long time fan of D'Angelo's music 
since his Brown Sugar debut. So to say that this album was a complete 
let-down for me is an understatement. The main problem lies in its 
repetitive overuse of the typical multilayered vocals that has become 
D'Angelo's signature sound. A far cry from Voodoo, his neo-funk 
masterpiece, Black Messiah seems to emulate some of its loosely structured 
musical style, yet suffers from a cacophonic redundancy that makes good 
listening difficult. "
"Solid... This album is everything I wanted it to be... My only 2 critiques: 1) The 
lyrics are hard to make out here and there but I've noticed that throughout 
history of soul music's greatest entertainers - the harder to decipher, the 
heavier the message. I wonder if it's on purpose especially considering 
that's not an oversight the people involved would have. Can a brotha get 
some liner notes lol. Still jammin regardless... 2) The mix/master isn't A1 
but it's still solid... you won't be disappointed. Another Life, Prayer, 
and Really Love are my personal standouts (for now) but I can play this 
album beginning to end (and have several times already lol). Only reason 
it's not 5 is because of the muddled lyrics on certain records and the mix 
but they're far from deal breakers. I'll be bumping this one for a while. "
"Love it!!! Took me a while to get into and really appreciate each song, but it was 
definitely worthwhile! I saw the album cover on iTunes a couple of years 
ago and thought that it was 2 old people making old people songs... I was 
completely wrong LOOOOL "
"The best album ever I love twenty one pilots and this album is just showcasing the skills 
Tyler has as a singer and Josh's skills as a drummer. Both are so very 
gifted and such a great duo "
"An excellent album I looooooove this band! I can't wait for them to get bigger and bigger and 
this album is just a sign of the things to come! /-| "
"Great album, awesome band Bought this because I heard Car Radio so often and definitely don't regret 
it! Awesome album that was better than I expected it would be. Looking 
forward to seeing what they do next. "
"Awesome! Love hese guys! Saw them at a music festival and instantly fell in love 
with their music! Hope this get bigger! "
TØP top saved me. I love these guys so much 
"Uniquely a masterpiece! So different to many of the other albums out there and ever so happy to 
listen to! "
"Twenty øne piløts is one of my favourite band in the history of life and 
this has some of my favourite songs on it "
So creative and deep The lyrics of every song are so well crafted and presented. 
I'll be holding onto this album 
Great One of those albums that you don't have to skip songs you don't like 
Not for me I lasted ten seconds listening to the free track. Not. A. Fan. 
Hmmm Booo. Its ok 
where is Regional At Best though? 
True art in a music form. Videos are awsome. 5 stars all the way. 
Amazing album Love them so much! X 
Awesome Love it! Especially Run and Go 
Epic One of the best albums of the year 
Thank you 
Best album ever!!!!! Class album with class songs!! 
Fudging amazing 
Great album Nice tracks 
|-/ Favorite tøp album 
Awesome Album of the year 
OMG Amazing single 
Amazing Obviously amazing 
Cool Awesome :-) 
Fantastic album 
"Great mix! Love this. Normally don't buy Grammy cds due to lack of my faves. This 
album has a good mix of pop and country genres. I don't get why people are 
complaining. They should simply look at the song list and if they don't 
like the songs, don't listen! Simple! I think some people just like to 
complain. Sad, really! Great album! "
"What happened? Seriously, did we forget last year's Grammy's? Like that award show was 
supposed to be the turning point for proper award-giving. All of the music 
selected now is pop junk again and is not critically acclaimed anymore. 
Aphex Twin should step up and snatch every award just to show how pathetic 
and incapable people are in creativity and representation. "
"No real music anymore I don't get why the ones nominated for a grammy are ones about witch craft 
and where there is a naked girl swinging on a wrecking ball for anyone to 
see.There are so many artists that deserve to get a grammy more than these. 
Like the script for example. They have a song called superheros that i have 
never heard on the radio. It is actually a song song life, about overcoming 
the odds and becoming a successful being.But you will never see them get a 
grammy.They work so hard and don't get the credit they need. "
"Real music is fading Music today is missing the human element. Some of these tracks aren't bad, 
but a majority of them need to go. The artists and bands that deserve 
Grammy's won't be recognized for their efforts until they're gone. Such a 
shame. "
"Disappointed The Grammy nominations for this year are very disappointing. All the music 
that I see on this list are bland radio fodder. Where are the talented 
musicians that deserve Grammy's? Including Iggy Azalea as a nominee for 
Music's most prestigious award really? I'm not hating on her but come on 
seriously! "
"2015 Grammys Music??? I don't think we've HAD the Grammys yet. Country have their OWN 
awards show. The only fun thing? Havin AC/DC play in the beginning. The 
rest was Yawn City! "
"""Well..."" I have some respect for some of the artist of ""Grammy Award 2015,"" 
however. I felt (in my opinion) like this year Grammy was a let down. "
"this is alright.... I respect some artists like iggy azalea, sam smith, 
pharrel williams, and ed sheeran but miley cyrus???? I thought the grammys 
was supposed to be for talented artists not people who swing on wrecking 
balls with no clothes on.... and I thought glory was nominated too?? wtf?? "
"Where has real music went? Mostly terrible songs, no lyrical emotion in almost all of them, stay with 
me, all of me, and take me to church aren't bad but its all mostly junk. "
When Childish Gambino isn't included You guys might've made money if you included him but no you messed it up 
"Money+Popularity=Talent? Proof that either the Grammy's are popularity contest or music sucked this 
year. I have respect for some of these artists but.... Hardly their best 
effort "
"No Pentatonix They're Grammy nominated and fresher act out there and not even here. 
Lame. "
"Mostly made up of crappy popular music. But all of me should win best song 
ever "
Popular music these days is lame Front to back barf! Even the Country songs/artists suck lol. 
"Mediocrity on Parade Got a coin to flip? That's as good a way as any to decide who is the best 
of this bunch. "
"Idk... It feels like the Grammys are just nominating the most POPULAR songs of 
2014, I'm not hating on thses artists, but I mean really? "
"Whats wrong with this generation Seriously do u call this music they all are almost the same fuckin thing 
especially iggy are u kidding me iggy....piggy...grammy...common PEOPLE im 
12 and i know this generation music is just not the same "
"Just pop I like a few of these songs. The thing is the a mostly pop. BTW Bastille 
was nominated and there song is not here "
Nice mix of pop music I like this kind of music for work. This way I don't have to do the mix! 
"Terrible I couldn't stomach ANY of these people. They call this music?! Seriously 
this is GARBAGE. Move on..... "
Battle of the turds Which turd is your favorite this year? 
"My vote never counts Why Taylor swift has to win every year let some else win an award like 
Katy perry she never wins one. "
What even Wtf is happening to music? All went down hill after Kurt died 
revolution end these songs right now 
Music My song shake it off 
Grammy The Grammys did an excellent job in picking all the winners 
Shake it off I hate it so much. 
"I love it Best album ever. I have no idea which people think that it is rubbish 
because it is amazing and if I knew how to download this album I 
would!!!!!!!!! Don't not ,not what to download this album download it now 
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! "
"Some were okay on this list but honestly some I've never even heard of 
before that don't deserve to be here anyway "
All of me John legend just keeps getting better. 
Nothing good Lip sync central 
Its good but music is fading Why is the music fading???? 
"Popular No surprise, there is nobody on here worth mentioning at all. "
Half of them would not go past the first round in any reality music show. 
HANLEY GONZALEZ ANGELA Disney Aladdin Music Video Come See About Me Doll Music Video 
Cobain lives on Fav nirvana album since AM really good vocal harmonies by kyrt crabane 
Not good better music out there This sucks 
All about that bass Itsnhhj 
Meh... Seriously. Popular music today is forgettable at best. 
Only one good song The only good song on this entire album with good writing was blue moon 
"Surprised!! She has a raspy rock n roll voice with a bit of soul infused. Interesting 
and intriguing mix. I read the reviews and was skeptical but her style and 
catchy songs caught my attention. She has my sale!! "
"It's about time.. ..we had a REAL female singer finally. ...only other truly great female 
singers I can name are Janis Joplin and Amy winehouse...both of who died at 
27...Elle is 26...be careful Elle. "
"Love the entire album! I can't remember the last time I've listened to an album and loved every 
single song in it. She's my new favorite artist! "
"My guilty pleasure As a middle aged guy I am kind of embarrassed but I really like this 
album. Her voice is really rich with a smart southern twang that is just so 
catchy. "
"Great debut album Well produced, some downright bluesy feel to some of the songs, others 
sincere, with a few radio friendly songs thrown into the mix. Well worth 
spending your money on. "
"Love it! She sounds like my other favorite artist (Gin Wigmore). It scared me how 
close there voices sound! "
"Nice Change This album makes me want to take a long drive in the country side. The 
lyrics speak to my wandering soul. Best addition to my collection in awhile "
"Incredible.Beautiful. This is one of the best albums I've ever listened to. Each song sounds 
amazing and has so much soul and meaning. Definitely worth what it's 
selling for, definitely worth way more than that actually. Buyyyyyy it. "
"Issue Got Fixed I contacted support and they fixed my issue where I couldn't play any of 
the songs I purchased. Heard this song on the radio, loved it, shazamed it, 
bought LOL. "
"Ex's & Oh's Keep them coming Elle King! AKA Rob Schnieder's beautiful bombshell 
daughter is a talented singer, songwriter and musician who has a fresh 
sound that rivals the top well-known artists of our time. "
"Amazing! Best album I've heard in a very long time! Reminds me of Janis Joplin/Amy 
Winehouse with a country twang! Hope to hear lots more from this artist! "

that's a good thing! "

Elle King is The Queen I am obsessed with her music. In love with her voice and unique style 
"See You Again Elle King sings the secrets our thoughts keep quiet, and belts out the 
truths our hearts long to scream. "
"Very talented As you go down the CD she goes from super cool UK punk to country to 
classic rock "
"Best Album I've heard in a long time Her album is awesome! I've been waiting for it for over a year and it was 
definitely worth the wait. "
"Annoying. Hate it, she's such a fake. And her voice is awful, she sounds like 
Christian Bale in ""The Dark Knight,"" but more offkey and echoe-ey. "
"Great album King hits many different genres in this album with a very unique voice. I 
can't stop listening to it, so so good! "
I am obsessed with Elle! So refreshing to hear great artists:)
