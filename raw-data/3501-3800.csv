sounds decent wiz still got it "
Blacc Hollywood A great album listen to it every day.. 
"Have you forgotten? Wiz's music is dope because you can SMOKE TO IT...it's pure stoner music

Epic album Cant stop listening to it classic song 
Wizard of Music Wiz Khalifa continues to impress with his newest album 
"Awesome As an artist he expressed him self through his music and its a tad 
different from the others "
Nope. Why are his mixtapes. Better than his albums? 
"Wiz! where did you go??? What happened bro. Your new sh*t has gotten wiggity wiggity wiggity wack 
bro. Go back to ""Welcome to Pistolvania"". Ive been listening since 2005. 
Your making a believer a non believer. "
"Wiz Good job. Added mad auto tune with terrible lyrics. No wonder all you 
drones are eating it up "
Garbage Why would anyone waste their money on this crap? No talent at all. 
Rolling papers was his best album. O.n.i.f.c was cool to but this... idk.. 
"OnePlus One Poor dude. Lost one of the two finest women on Earth . He'll get another 
one, though. "
"WIZ KHALIFA I absolutely love this mutha fucka he is one of the best rappers 
ever!!!!!! "
All his songs be catchy af. 5 stars 
"Awesome! Great album! I don't know many of his songs but, from this album I can say 
that I like his music! Some REAL hip hop music.. And........ for 99¢, well, 
you can't beat that! "
STILL DOWN Nice tracks with his lyrics and style 
Get the deluxe version for more songs its not exclusive to itunes 
"Awesome He's been my idol for a while these songs help me there classic and are 
good to listen to when your down if anyone has troubles listen to this all 
that's happened to him your life don't seem so bad. So yh it helps XD "
"Eminem One of the best rappers I've ever listened to; however, wish he could 
express himself without the explicit language. Makes great points in songs 
but unable to share with certain age groups. Personal opinion. "
"Nice- Eminem is great. Hes my 2nd fav. I also recommend KiD CuDi, lil wayne, 
chiddy bang, related artists, although not as good as eminem "
"Can't beat a classic..Haterz Can't Stop This Eminem was and is the only rapper I listen to I love his new stuff but you 
can't beat his classics the beats and lyrics are phenomenal..I highly 
recommend this album to anyone that likes Eminem or rap in general "
"Genius I don't think these are his best hits there are a bunch of better songs 
missing but still eminem is the 2nd best rapper all time. "
"Amazingly awesome Eminem has been my idol for as long as I can rememberhe makes great songs 
about his life he gets all his inspiration from his child hood I wanna be 
just like him when I get older "
"Fanatastic Eminem is the absalout KING of rap anyone who said nikki manaj is the 
female version of this guy is WRONG! "
"Great (as usual) Eminem be talking bout his life but turns it into a joke. He's the 
greatest rapper but that's just my opinion "
"Best album I've heard in a long time I'm not really a rap fan but this album is amazing, the lyrics are so 
well-written and smart. "
"Great The songs ""when I'm gone"" and ""mocking bird"" were great. But they made me 
very sad cause they had meaning and it was just amazing. "
"I LOVE IT. one of the best albums ever, no question. best rapper ever, no question. "
"Decent This album contains most of Slims number one hits in his early years. Let 
me just say that the album is great! Though it lacks certain songs that 
were also hits like til'I collapse and superman. In addition the album 
contains 4 other songs that Em made for this. Shake that is a really good 
one and Stan remains one of my favorite. Fack has hilariously disgusting 
lyrics (many wonder why it's on a greatest hits album). Over all this is a 
good combination of Ems hits and is worth buying "
"The best of the best He's been my idol since I was 4 man when I listen to him he motivates me 
to keep going and its not the end and it will get better then sometimes he 
tells the truth "
"Everyone should listen to this Album at least three x's This album will take y go u to a place in another realm. He brought the 
rap game to a different level and did something that no1 else could. Any1 
who doesnt like him should check themselves. "
"Greatest ever Every time I listen to this album the hairs on my arms and neck stand up 
as if it was an audience giving a standing ovation. Can't get enough "
"Best Album This album is just great. Eminem chose all his classic song to put on one 
great album. From ""My Name Is"" to ""Lose Yourself,"" this album will take 
through Eminem's rap career. 6/5! Beyond Excellent. "
"Best MC Eminem is amazing. I love him. I love this album. I like his stuff. what I 
like the most is that he raps or MC's about real things that have happened 
to him. his songs are relatable. Best Master of Ceremonies. MC is better 
than rapping tbh "
"Love love love Love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love 
love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love 
love love love love love love "
"By far the best bits but nothing on his new lp! Peeps spouting its his best lp must be oblivious to the fact its a best 
hits album so is bound to full of great tracks....after his re up/relaspe 
flops he has produced his finest lp yet & if not got it do so deluxe 
version too!still good to hear his old stuff tho as a fan prefer the whole 
show but for the number ones this is great:-) "
"A mix of some of his best work Most of these aren't separate songs, but rather old ones put together on 
one album. If you already have the other albums, just listen to them there. 
If not, this is a good album to start on- Some of his best work here. The 
only song specifically made new for this album is Fack, and that is on the 
list of his worst work, and that took away a star for me. Skip that and 
listen to the rest. This is the Eminem that the hip hop community found 
great, not the modern one that's soft and has no lyrical depth. Money 
changes people and their work, it happens to all artists. Eminem's golden 
age is long gone. This is back when he was original and had a good feel to 
it. Yeah, imagine that, I'm going against 'mainstream' opinion- since 
Relapse he has gone downhill.. Far downhill. Why is he so soft now? Afraid 
to hurt someone's feelings? Marshal Mathers LP 2 doesn't change that image. 
Em, tip; you can't go soft then expect to be considered cool again by 
calling someone a fag. Golden age of Eminem is summarized in this one 
album, it's a must-buy for all fans and people trying to get into it. "
"Eminem is... ...an excellent Rapper. I can't say he is the best rapper ever as some 
reviews state but he is one of the best. His style is awesome and the way 
he delivers it is outstanding. I really enjoy his music. He is creative and 
fresh but not the best I've ever heard. As for him being white...He is the 
best white Rapper I've ever heard to date. A lot of my friends can't stand 
him and I know it is due to the color of his skin (reverse racism if you're 
good, you're good). To: EMUINEM...Keep up the good work...you are awesome 
and one of the best out there. Tim "
"Classic em tracks but... LISTEN TO THE AMAZING ALBUMS. Don't be the person who claims Eminem is the 
only good rapper ever, but only have heard his ""greatest hits"" that 
includes fack for whatever reason, and have only heard rap god outside of 
curtain call "
"love it i have listened to eminem since i was 11 and im now nearly 22 and although 
his songs have gotten more serious and dark than his earlier tracks he 
still is my favourite artist and out of all his songs i have yet to find 
one i don't like, this album has the best of the best on it "
f***ing awesome Best of Eminem... He's new songs are a joke (rap god & the monster) 
"He has rappin disease good version, Best rapper alive OBVIOUSLY! I have all his songs!! Lose yourself & when 
I'm gone are some of my favs, keep it cool "
"Shady 4 life I love Marshall and his music and I try to do the same every day my 
friends call me the second slim shady I know all the songs on top of my 
head so.... I even met Shady himself and it was an honor to meet him and 
ive bern kinda going trough alot but basicly same shit that happened to 
Marshall so his songs relate to me especially When I'm gone . Thast all 
thank you for letting me share(i threw a quote in if you dont realize that) "
"Eminem This guy is one of the best rappers but I find his songs to long and some 
of them are just messed "
"Amazing I recommend you buy all of his other early albums because they are so 
good. This one is obviously good (its a hits album) but its missing some of 
the best songs; till I collapse and criminal to name a few "
"Love it I've listend to eminem since I was 4 has been a long fuckin time now I'm 
15 listend to him all my life "
"Slim shady All pretty good songs. Fack was hilarouse. Turns life into one big joke. 
And they could of left out the song Stan but it showed his emotions at the 
time but still good. "
"Nobody Like Him He is and still is one of the best rappers alive, He was amazing with 
his..addictions but we all know he's not gonna be that person again. Give 
the GOD a chance with his new music. When I first listened to ""Kings Never 
Die"" I got chills, a real die hard fan wouldnt care if he changed from his 
drugs etc. He is just as amazing clean. So R.i.p slim shady. "
"Dec Been listening to Em since I was 11 he's a genius with a pad an pen will 
always buy his music "
"Curtin Call How can somebody not love the collection of the best eminem songs. The 
only down point is the first song on the album :FACK; cause,let's be 
honest, it sucks. But Stan , The way I am ,Lose Yourself, The real slim 
shady; the list goes on . These are some of hip-hops best songs "
Eminem when he was good I prefer eminem on drugs i know its bad to say but he was so better 
"MUST BUY for fans of Rap/hip- hop My personal favourite Eminem album, I listen to this album all the time no 
matter what mood I'm feeling, it's really helped me through some tough 
times in my life and has helped to make it better when things are going 
well. The collection of songs here are amongst some of my favorites(Stan, 
The real slim shady, Guilty Conscience, lose yourself). Eminems best work 
really is shown in this album, his work really puts modern day rap and 
hip-hop artists to shame. To sum this up, buy this album. "
"Eminem gud. Ad rayt it 3t4 I av arlways liket eminem sins i first herd stan nd his lyrics remynd u of 
how life can b this albem doze just that definetly one ov hiz gud ones! 3 "
"I love eminem I know there is swearing and stuff but, lots of his songs mean thing. My 
favourites are ""When I'm gone"" and ""without me. Eminem is my role model, I 
love him and his songs "
"EMINEM, curtaincall Brilliant, I could sit ere and listen to his music all day. Can't rate 
anything but 5 stars. "
"I, wanna facking, fack. The greatest! No one is on the same level as Eminem lyrically. Eminem's 
the best at being able to tell a story, and have the whole thing rhyme 
perfectly. One of many great albums. "
I love eminent he's such a good singer Especially when I'm gone I feel be as for him and Hailey sad face 
"Holy buckets! This album is so powerful and emotional all at the same time. One thing 
Carrie has always been good at is writing songs that people really connect 
with and she's done it again. ""The girl you think I am"" had me in tears. "
Will be just as good as all the other ones. LOVE THE COVER PHOTO. SO BEAUTIFUL EVEN WITH THE HAIR NOT PERFECT 
"The Crossover Queen Reigns With this current compilation, Carrie Underwood continues to 
(effortlessly) cross over the genre line from Country to Pop and back again 
providing a variety of delicious ear candy guaranteed to satisfy nearly 
every music taste. Lyrically lush as well, ""Storyteller"" is the perfect 
choice for the title. "
"I loved all her precious albums But this one just sounds the same. Each song is really similar and there 
is nothing really different that catches me like her last album. I still 
love her music though just not these that much. "
"Amazing It is no surprise that I love this album. She's amazing. She can do no 
wrong. "
"I love Jeffrey Huff, but he's in love with Carrie Underwood so I'm out!!!! 
He recently went to her concert and I hope his dad is taking him to see her 
again in Charlotte very soon!!!! Hint hint Jeff and Pam Huff!!! All you 
have to do is mention Carrie Underwood's name and Jeffrey just lights up 
with that beautiful smile of his!!!!! I just wish Carrie knew about her 
admirer and could actually meet Jeffrey!!!! That's my prayer tonight that 
Jeffrey gets to meet Carrie!!! Everyone please whisper that same prayer 
tonight and in the days to come!!!! Thanks in advance Family and 
Friends!!!! Let's help make my friend Jeffrey a HAPPY MAN!!!!! "
"Very Underwhelming I was so excited for this album, but ended up disliking it when I listened 
to it. Carrie said it was going to contain more ""twang,"" but I don't hear 
much at all. It's a pop album that's overproduced and most songs have 
similar, if not the same, themes. There are a few good and interesting 
songs, but overall it's not a great album. Blown Away was much better. "
"She never disappoints! Every song is great! Choctaw County Affair felt very Reba's ""Lights Went 
Out In Georgia""! The Girl You Think I Am may be the song I dance with my 
mom (single mother) at my wedding! Great album!!!! "
"Love it!! This is one of her best albums!!! Her voice sounds great and I love the 
different sounds she's using both musically and vocally. "
"Storyteller The problem I've always had with Carrie is her overpowering voice, but I 
think she did a good on this album. This album has some great songs, my 
favorite being ""Choctaw County Affair"". It would have been better if it 
didn't include ""Chaser"", it sounds like any other country song to me to be 
honest. The scenario in ""Church Bell"" seems to familiar. It's like a cross 
between ""Gunpowder and Lead"" by Miranda Lambert and ""Fancy"" by Reba. 
Overall I liked most of the album and it's definitely my favorite by 
Carrie. "
"♡♡♡♡♡ LOVE what I've heard so far & can't wait to hear the rest!!!!!! ☆☆☆☆☆ Can't wait for this album to be released!! I LOVE the sound Carrie & her 
cowriters achieved & the direction this album is taking. She's at the top 
of her game & will undoubtedly draw a whole new listening audience with the 
country sound her new album upholds throughout -- unlike any of her 4 
previous albums. So excited to see her on tour again & to hear each 
individual track in their entirety! Long live Carrie & the beauty, class, 
integrity & unparalleled talent she brings to all she does! ❤❤ "
"Another Amazing CD by Carrie I bought this the day it came out and I am not disappointed. She never 
seizes to amaze me. I get lost listening to her voice, truly of an angel 
and just captures you. Best and most natural beautiful artist out there. 
Shes an artist I will always support because shes so full of talent and 
emotion and her songs reflect meaning, that of a storyteller. Absolutely 
love Carrie and always have, buy if you havent already youll love it. 
Theres a song for everyone, especially if your a mom like myself and 
Carrie. "
"Wow Carrie YOU definitely did it again!!! You are remarkable! I absolutely 
love your last song! I feel like you love Motherhood! It's like that last 
song is for your new son!!!! I think that's very sweet!!! Motherhood keeps 
getting better!!! Good job girl! You are my #1 artist to listen to! I'm 
more then excited to buy this new album! My 9 year old son loves you too!!! 
You are hard not to love! :-) Well done! "
"This is by far her best album she's released. Putting it simply, this album 
is fire. As the title suggests, these are amazing stories and everything 
just belongs here. Starting with the first single ""Smoke Break"" , which was 
a good enough country/twangy/rock song, turned out to be pretty average 
compared to the rest of the album. However, it's still pretty great and 
different from her other songs. ""Choctaw County Affair"" is one of the best 
songs, if not the best, of her career. This song is pure sass and has a 
very interesting storyline that deserves to be heard. While ""Dirty Laundry"" 
and ""Church Bells"" are #1 hits in the making. ""Chaser"", one of my all time 
favorites from her, ""Relapse"", and ""Clock Don't Stop"" could dominate the 
pop charts; all 3 being extremely catchy and addicting. Then there are 
songs like ""Renegade Runaway"" and ""Mexico"" that show off her impeccable 
strong vocals, making sure we know she's deserving of any female vocalist 
award in any genre. Taking it easy on the vocals, she also throws in some 
soft vocals. There are love songs such as: ""Heartbeat"" and ""Like I'll Never 
Love You Again""(the best love song of her career). Both are a welcome 
addition to her catalogue. ""The Girl You Think I Am"" and ""What I Never Knew 
I Always Wanted"" are also beautifully written and very personal songs to 
Carrie. Overall, this album is stellar and deserves success. She worked 
hard on this album and you can tell through how great these songs are. 
Definitely worth a listen. "
"This is definitely one of her best! This album is amazing, you won't regret purchasing it!! She is already 
known to have such a beautiful voice but then she writes beautiful songs 
and its just amazing. Even her upbeat songs (which I'm not always a fan of) 
are very well written and sung with such power and strength! "
"Storyteller' I'm a big fan of Carrie Underwood? Got all her CD 's I can't wait to get 
this one And besides I voted for her when she was on American Idols! "
"Wow! I was really just planning on listening to another Carrie Underwood album. 
That is not a mean gesture at all. I love her music but after awhile it all 
starts to sound the same with most artists. This album, is different. 
Carrie sounds seasoned, the songs are intimate, and I absolutely love every 
single one. What I Never Knew I wanted is my personal favorite b/c it 
reflects me as well. This is by far her best album she's ever made. "
"Love it Only one question: Why wasn't the killer track ""Dirty Laundry"" released as 
the first single off the album?. "
"Awesome Good for all occasions. Candle light dinners, slow dancing. Even fast 
dancing if you can keep up with it. "
"Carrie Underwood storyteller Impressed with this album as well as all the others absolutely love it 
definitely glad I got it love Carrie Underwood my idol these are a lot more 
upbeat but still no let downs for me "
"Amazing!!! I Love The Story She Tells!! She's Done It Again!! And I thought 
I was Blown Away Last Time ;) "
"That song chaser,relapser,clock dont stop...she killed it! Im sold. Love 
her album! "
"Excellent album All her hard work really paid off. Such a beautiful album. The 3-4 minute 
movies are amazing. This is what I call great music! "
"I love this album I love carrie underwood she is amazing and her new album makes me listen 
and love her more "
"GOLLY, THIS GOOD! Well, you'd rather listen to this than have Jesus tan your hide! A found 
this when my pa and me were at the ranch shootin up some supper. [imitation 
used] "
"AMAZING Carrie has the ability to speak to each persons heart through her powerful 
music. She's been so incredibly blessed and her music blesses me. Put 
country music aside and know she's amazing no matter what genres you like. "
"Super She puts so much heart and passion in every song she sings she is 
beautiful lady inside and out "
Carrie is the best. Great album. Amazing songs. Loved all the emotions she put into this. 
"High Anticipation If this whole album is anything like its new lead single, then we're all 
going to be ""Blown Away""!! Lol. "
"Renegade Runaway I love this song i wish i can see her. If. I hope you do you like this 
song you should put it down this is chelsea "
"Amazing Perfection as always! Love me some Carrie Underwood. Love the last one 
alot! She can do no wrong in my book! "
"Great Sound!!!! I love this album! Have always been a fan of Carrie Underwood! Love the 
country rocking sound! Can't wait to see her in concert!!! "
Storyteller- Carrie Underwood Awesome album. My favorite of hers so far. 
Love her! It's always on repeat. She never let's me down. 
Don't and won't CAN'T get any better than the Queen of country! (Sabrina) 
"Storyteller Amazing album been my idol since American idol and I love how strong And 
passionate you are "
Awesome Songs are amazing fav. One is smoke break 
Excited Just preordered mine and can't wait to get the whole album. 
"Loved her new album All of her songs are amazing, beautiful and moving. I absolutely love her 
songs in this album. "
anything Carrie sings is heavenly. her voice can move mountains. ❤ 
"Still the man.. Keep doing what you do homeboy.. love the new beats!!! Wish there were a 
few more but still putting it down! Outstanding!!! Makes you wanna get up 
and move "
"I love this song Thanks for your time. It is a good idea to have a good idea to have a good 
idea to have a good idea to have a good idea to have a good idea to have a 
good idea to have a good idea to have a good idea to have a good idea to

"Garbage Flo rida's career is over. He made a few good songs but he should just 
quit while he's ahead "
Hi!! It's me Amanda Good song My house I have this song on my cellphone. 
"Is that an original song I here? It doesn't sample anything, to my knowledge. Its not the best song, but 
""My House"" is a marked improvement. "
"Refund I paid 2 times for I don't like it I love it and the first time it said 
added to library but when I go see in my library it's not there I still 
bought it a second time cause like the song but like really I feel roped 
off I expect 1.29 $ back I even have proof if u need it !!!!! "
"Wow Straight golden summer beats, can't wait to bump this at the beach ! "
I love songs and if u like songs get these. Get these songs now. 
"This is his best album yet,Flo I think is the most popular rapper that does 
not use profanity in songs. "
Uplifting In a bad mood? This could lift you up any day! 
I love this album but the prices are so high change it to 0.99 
Complete garbage. I hear better stuff come from my toilet. 
"FLO RIDA -My House As with any musicians album's... it has a couple of great songs on it and 
the rest I could do without. It seems very rare in life to find an album 
that you love all or most songs on it.. so, it's about average. His album 
before last was much MUCH better than this new one (in my humble 
opinion)!!! But I'm buyin' anyway. . . I've been DYING for some fresh 
tunes!!! ☆ "
Love him Love love love it it it l don't like it I love it 
Good thing Awesome 
Awwsome I love it so much I can't stop listening to it 
Keep it up I really liked these songs. 
This one of Flo ridas best albums I think 
"Mainstream trash No real hip hop head would even consider listening to this. These reviews 
are littered with fake accounts. This music is made with no soul or heart, 
it's purely put together to make money. "
Flo rida Best 7 song album ever 
"Help! I bought it, but I can't download it, I can only stream it and even then 
it's taking me to the radio station. Please help or give me my money back "
Love Love this song lol so good 
"It was so great Flo Rida makes good music but I will say this his music can be to up beat 
at times. "
I luve my house. Good song 
.night and the Lord Jesus and you don't need anything 
69 one stars(; those people are gonna get butt-fucked 
mishell vaneessa merrryland ser dee os ko 
Nice Cool 
Amazing I have this album on repeat. 
It's cool LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Jk Lickers like pizza pie in the mouth 
This guy isn't even out of Compton 
Best This album is my favorite!!! I luv it! 
My house It's an awesome album 
Minecraft 17/49\2 
Lovin it These songs are the ones that actually toched me and make me feel happy. 
This is best album he made 
"Much better This is much better than Flo Ridas other albums... not as corny. But only 
7 songs? Really? "
"Great But there is a way you can get just my house for less people gotta save my 
money "
It's Going Down 4 Real! Ghetto Mc.Swaggin 
"Stop I know u people might not like their singing but no need to criticize they 
try their best and how would u feel if someone said that u were sooooo 
annoying I want to punch my TV they are only kids :'( :'( "
"Don't like They say its a kid friendly version of today's biggest hits. You could 
just search the song you want and add "" clean version "" to the search. They 
are just embarrassing themselves. That's probably why they sing in groups. 
I know what I said is kind of harsh but the truth hurts sometimes. They 
also sing different clean lyrics that a lot of people don't like. "
"Boooooo! Kidz bop kids just take the best songs and totally ruin them and make them 
REALLY LAME! Seriously people save your money. They are just ripping off 
today's best songs and totally ruining them. They are just pretending to 
sing to make some money . All you people who think they are amazing singers 
you have another thing coming. Don't be fooled by those jerks . So the next 
time you go and ask your parents for the next kidz bop CD, think twice 
before you do. "
"Bruh How is it legal for them to steal the entire master track and lyrics from 
songs and then sell them? If I tried to do this I would be in federal 
prison at at least have some serious copyright infringement fines. This 
literally just ruins songs and is borderline illegal. There Iggy verses are 
literally trash. I mean I guess you can change 50% of the lyrics but I 
would suggest finding a new song if it was too much profanity. What's next 
Up! By Loverance? "
"KIDZ BOB= AWESOME I think everyone that says KIDZ BOP is dumb, stupid, and retarted is 
WRONG. I haven't even bought this album but I'm a big fan of KIDZ BOP and I 
only have KIDZ BOP 25!!! Keep on coming, KIDZ BOP!! "
"Best thing ever I love kidz bop it is a little better than iggy azalea kidz bop is the 
best music for children "
"Utter trash This is some of the worst music I have ever heard--and I'm saying this 
after listening to ""Lifestyle."" I would not be surprised if ISIS were 
responsible for pumping out this cacophony in order to elicit mass suicide 
amongst the other countries. If that's true--actually, regardless of its 
verity, the United States et al. should refocus their efforts from bombing 
the Islamic State to ridding the world of Kidz Bop. "
"Stop Hating Everybody JUST STOP! They are children just like me. If you don't like it 
then stop listening. "
"All about that bass,Maps,Fancy,Rude,Shower,and Problem! I loved 1.because it is a great song.2.I love the tune and.3.I LOVE KIDZ 
BOP AND ALL OF THE SONGS ON IT#awesome:) "
"True talent U haters out there have NO taste of music!!!!! It is awesome so shut up u 
stupid non- lovers of Kidz Bop!! They do not take good music and turn it to 
bad music!!!! You're just jealous that u can't sing that 
good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
"Just stop this I can't take it I love these kids they are awesome if you guys are going to hate them then 
hate but I will stand up with them and you commenters who say they are 
stupid well you guys are jerks you guys make me want to punch my 
tablet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
"Terrible It changes everything up and then the song is like crap. They always mess 
up the songs. They blocked out ""women"" on Shut Up and Dance in Kidz Bop 29. 
I'm fed up with thier music. "
"Kids Bob is safe for kids because they cut out all the cuss words.., so 
exactly and the people who hate kids Bob are aloud to say and listen to 
cuss words so that sums it up right there!!!! And then one more thing...

REALLY GOOD SINGERS!!! DO NOT LET THE HATERS GET TO YOU!!! GOOD GOOD GREAT 
REALLY GREAT AWSOME BEST!!!! "

lyrics for kids and there is no bad word so just be a kid again "
"What happened? In one song they sound really bad but I know that they are trying their 
best! Thank you kidz bop I love all of your songs! You are the best! You 
all have amazing singing voices! All you haters are just stupid! Why would 
you want to say bad things about the best songs ever? My mom even loves 
kidz bop she says that Kidz bop is best because they don't have swearing 
and bad language! Kidz bop just don't listen to the haters! You know you 
are awesome! Go Kidz bop! Please make more albums! You guys are great! "
"My kids and I have been listening to kids bop since they were tiny....They 
are still young enough to enjoy the songs and I don't have to be driving 
along listening to swearing and inappropriate language...Thank you kidz 
bop!!! To all the haters,,save your energy for something else,,this is for 
small children..You sound silly reviewing children's songs..... "
"awsome let the haters hate, this is a good cuss free thing for kids. :-) keep 
singing kidz bop "
"Omg really Ok you buy kidz bop because you have kids and don't want them to grow up 
to be ignorant trash talking lunatics like the grown ups on here talking 
about children I do realize that you can get the clean version else where 
but my kids like this version and so we have it Grow the heck up and leave 
the kids alone "
"Annoying I want to punch my T.V every time I see a kids bop commercial. They ruin 
songs for me and they're song choice is very limited (mainstream songs). 
I've always hated kids bop growing up as a kid and I still do. Please stop 
and save our ears! "
"I love their singing I love their singing but the people who don't they are trying there best 
so don't just say there bad there horrible so there not they are trying 
their best so Don't do it. "
"People stop critizing Stop saying they suck!! They are only kids and they are trying to do there 
best. If you think they're lame, then don't listen to them! You people 
don't have to be mean to these kids!! "
"Quit all this nonsense All of you who posted bad reviews about Kidz Bop and cussing at them is 
stupid stop all this nonsense because Kidz Bop is a great album for all 
ages, or I'm calling the police!!! "
"You guys success I love your music you guys rock I love you so much you guys seem so so 
gooood I just don't like cool kids and all about that 
bass✌❄⛄✅✅✅✅✔✔✔✴✴✴✴✳✳:-D :-) ;-) O:-) :-$ "
"Its ok Lots of kids love listening to them but while udults dont seem to like it 
some songs can get annoying but think about if you were younger I think 
that its ok "
"love it i wish i could haver it and u haters can just go away and don't speak 
because its for kids. "
"It gave me AIDS I'm pretty sure this album gave me some form of AIDS and or cancer after 
listening to it. Please. Spare mankind and stop this nonsense before it's 
too late! Cancer isn't funny! "
"Lobe kids bop 27 turn up Problem and rude and all about that bass and shake it off and fancy and

"Love it Good, for you haters these are kids what if this was you singing and you 
were reading these comments how would you feel? if you agreed with me 
please put this:love kids bop "
"No Credit They are not giving the Artists the credit they deserve. Sure these kids 
are singing (autotune) the songs in a more appropriate way but come on.... 
If I took the same beat like they did I would have a law suit on my hands. "
BOO YOURSELVES IDIOTS! I'm A Huge Fan Of This! +1 If You Agree With Me! 
"Don't like it I think kids bop is getting to much hits.Once they sang a song I loved and 
they messed up the tune and they don't inspire me now because I like when 
the song writer who sang better.Kids bop I am not pleased. "
RUDE All of u hating are rude their music is awesome!!!!!

"Great quality, age appropriate! Lyric changes are sometimes funny. The kids sing great for their age. I'm 
a substitute teacher and daycare worker. The kids love to dance and listen 
to the music. I can also enjoy the music too with peace of mind. "
"The best album Dear Kidz Bop kids, you are really talented. This may be their best album 
yet! Keep on singing! Love Elijah Hannah Noah & Naomi Kwaku. PS. WE LOVE 
YOU SINGING!!!!!! "
Love it I like because it has all my fov. Song and the are all cool. Lol 
They sing bad Stupid they really sing bad dumb kids 
"Taylor Swift - Everything Has Changed from her album called 'Red'. This album is soooooo amazing!!!!!!! This is completely worth buying. I 
love the song especially 'Everthing Has Changed' Featuing Ed Sheeran. It 
has such a nice harmony togerther. Like this review if you think Taylor 
Swift should win the Teen Choice Award!! :D :P :) "
"Good but tries too hard This album is well and truly amazing but, because it tries to be a lot of 
genres, there are too many songs. Quality not quantity. Begin again and 
state of grace are crap but stay stay stay (a cheeky and incredibly catchy) 
and ikywt are both really good. "
"Good but not outstanding I liked this album and it was relativly easy on the ears. However after 
years of being countries poster girl, I fear that Swift is in danger of 
losing the edge, that made her more credible than every other teen pop 
star. Please Miss. Swift don't lose what made you so brilliant in the first 
place. "
"Breathtaking ""you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in 
the name of being honest"" what an amazing lyric and the best song in my 
opinion. The rest of the album is amazing also but all too well is my all 
time favourite :) "
"RED. Enchanted. Wonderstruck This is THE most amazing album ever, where you can relate to every single 
song, and just like the rest of Taylor's albums this one is also deep and 
addictive. I don't even think a review needs to be read.. BUY IT! "
"Not her best album Guys don't take this the wrong way, but this is her worst album! I mean.. 
I used to relate to her songs so intensely and now I just can't feel 
anything listening to her songs.. she's so much better than this! I love 
her Speak Now album it's flawless and she wrote the entire thing by herself 
what proves how talented she is. The only good thing about this album is 
All Too Well. That song is masterpiece! "
"This girl was trouble when she walked in Best album i've ever listened to, this girl is incredible her music is 
amazing and she is a fantastic role model it was totally worth the money "
"Lots of good songs. Some songs not so giid A lot of the songs in this album are really good and stay consistent with 
the genre and usual pattern of Taylir Swift songs. However there are some 
songs that spoil the album and sound more like Rebecca Black songs 
(remember her) "
"For ""Everything has Changed"" Taylor Swift ruined it Ed Sheeran is better off doing the song on his own, Taylor swift ruined 
it, I would of liked the song without her. "
You're great!!Taylor swift.... I love it Taylor swift....no.4 track.amazing!! 
"Yipee Taylor swift is a good artist but is she goin to be around for that long I 
mean where's tinie tempah and jls "
"EPIC! I'm not a fan but this is amazing! She has a lovely voice. I especially 
liked everything has changed. It is well worth buying "
"Disapointed I just bought this album but I have to have wifi ? And the hole resson I 
bought it was to listen on a non wifi plane on my holiday next month ? Why 
hasnt it gone into my album , help! Samsung tab 2 - faye neville :( "
"Love it!!!! It is upbeat and really good lyrics! I love you Taylor Swift! I wonder if 
this song is about her relationship with Harry Styles?! "
RED 22 and I Knew You Were Trouble are so hot 
"The Lucky One I wish Taylor had made The Lucky One a single instead of I Knew You Were 
Trouble. It's an AWESOME song!!! "
Amazing Taylor Taylor is my fav singer I wish I new you I can't go to your shows 
"Amazing Album From Taylor Swift....my favorite song is ""We Are Never Ever 
Getting Back Together"" "
love Taylor swift but can't you get it off youtbe for free? 
fave song we are never ever getting back together like ever. with some indie record that's much cooler than mine. 
"Bunzie I love her soooooooooo much wow my mate looks twin like her my mate is so 
lucky "
"RED, became my life! I can't praise this thing in words!! "
"This is my school choir song held by Mrs Dawson, miss Novak and miss walsh Love "
"Love it I love taylor swift and this is by far the best album Love u taylor!xox 2 
bad u have to pay to get it "
I <3 U TAYLOR SWIFT SHE WAS OLD THEN NOW SHES JUST GROWN AND IS AMAZING XXXX;-) 
"Tragic Awful generic trash. If you like whiney vocals, embarrassing lyrics and 
men being moaned about about in every song then go for it! "
Good You need to give taylor swift some credit for making that song 
LOVE HERR! wish you didn't have to pay for it:'( 
"love i knew u were trouble love this album especially i knew you were trouble and we are never 
getting back together "
"Tayler swift Thanks for this album I will be getting it soon I love tayler swift she 
rocks "
Red is my fave song!!!! I luv tht song well all her songs r. 
Trouble Cool music and great singing. I really like Taylor Swift!!! 
"Love it but... (I knew you were in trouble)IS AWSOME!!!!but its just that I wish songs 
were free "
We are never ever ever getting back tovether I loved it very much 
"Not her best To be honest I really like Taylor and was so disappointed when I heard 
most of the songs on this album. I knew u were trouble and 22were by far 
the best songs on the album "
Taylor swift Cool I like the song : 22 knew you were trouble 
"Poor Unoriginal sound with all the tent but meaningless lyrics and great album 
artwork,just stolen from Lana Del Rey. "
"Sooo good I am a big big big fan of taylor FYI you are amazing so the song loving it 
awsim as usual xx <3 xx :-* "
"Temika thomas I love you taylor swift ok you are the best song I can't get it hat of my 
he'd we are never det back to gether form temika I love you "
Great I think Fiona Moore needs to do some research 
"Fight Song helps me fight Living with a chronic illness is tough and this song helps my friends and 
I who have chronic illnesses remind us that we can do whatever we choose to 
do. This reminds us that we can fight and we will take back our lives. 
Illness does not define a person. I may have EDS but EDS is not who I am. 
It is just a hurdle to jump over on a daily battle. "
"Love it!!! Omg! I love ""Fight Song"" so much! Best song ever, but both songs cost 1.29 
each and the album is 2.99 but 1.29+1.29 is 2.58. But its no big deal "
"Dear Rachel, Reading all these hater's comments makes me wanna snap my nexus in half, 
as well as them. But u should ignore their nasty comments and keep doing 
what you love, by making music i love. There is no word to describe how 
much i love your songs. They are incredible. Keep it up. "
"Fight Song I Love this Song so much!! This is my Song because I will not give up the 
fight. Severe Chronic Pain along with other issues on a daily basis is 
extremely HARD + ANYONE WHO SUFFERS WITH IT DAILY KNOWS. THIS IS OUR FIGHT 
SONG, BECAUSE WE DON'T GIVE UP +WE KEEP ON GOING. BLESS ALL OF YOU OUT 
THERE. JUST LISTEN TO THIS SONG + IT WILL INSPIRE YOU!!! AMEN "
"It's cute. It's a cute song and it's obviously inspirational to a lot of folks, 
including children fighting terminal diseases. Back off with the hate, huh? 
And for everyone that says they'd like to buy it, but have no means to, you 
can download Google Opinion Rewards and every time you answer a survey, 
it'll put a few cents into a virtual bank account for you to use in the 
Play Store and they add up! I think the first survey you complete gives a 
dollar. "
"Love it This song really makes me feel confident it is just such a strong bold it 
is like a sign saying you don't have to be afraid to be you and it tells 
you your perfect and follow your heart so follow your cause I'll be 
following mine. "
"I hear this song on the radio a lot & i instantly fell in love with it. The 
lyrics really mean something to me. "
"She's basically a proto type Of Natasha Benifeield .. Idk how to spell it.. Clearly! But I know that 
she, (Natasha), was talented & creative..& definitely worth while!.. This 
girls voice sounds like hers'.. (& I thought this was her),.. She's copying 
sorta.. It seems to me anyway.. I suppose all are just newer versions of 
signers from ones generation. I looked @ top charts/songs or whatever & I 
didn't recognize a single Fricken artist! "
"Fight Song When my son dedicated this song to me I was overwhelmed with love & joy at 
first!!! The more I listen to this empowering art I strive daily to fight 
through my illness & achieve my day to day goals.!!!!! Her voice alone 
represents strength!!! Thank you. "
"FIGHT SONG I absolutely adore this song. I have been at an iffy point in life needing 
something at times to raise me up when I could not stand up myself. This 
song helps a lot. The lyrics motivate me to stay strong, hold on to a 
dream, keep fighting for ME & a better day ahead. I read a few other 
comments. It's amazing how many lives have been touched so deeply. I know 
that music helps individuals cope. I am one of those people. TRYING 2 STAY 
POSITIVE! **if this song helps people, why bash it? Just don't listen 2 it "
"Adore it It always makes me cheer up when I'm down and I can face my fears when I 
sing this like when I get in trouble I cry then I sing that song and it 
makes me not cry.And it also makes my dreams come true when I sing this 
song "
"Not top chart material. I hear it way to much. The lyrics may be inspiring to some, but As far as 
the musicality goes this song is about as creative as every other pop song 
out today. The song may get sound exactly like a completely different song 
due to its complete uninspiring lack of musical creativity. Song is boring 
and gives headaches. Yet somehow it influences some to feel ""empowered."" 
What a generation we live in. "
"I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH. WHO WOULDENT LIKE IT ANYWHY. IT MAKES ME STAND UP 
TO BULLIES ALOT.THIS IS MY FIGHT SONG TAKE BACK MY LIFE SONG PROVE IM 
ALRIGHT SONG AND IT DONT REALLY CARE I NO ONE ELSE BELIVES CAUSE I STILL 
GOT ALOT OF FIGHT LEFT IN ME I love this song so much I hate and I mean hate the people who hate this 
song cause I will truck them down and kill them lol "
"Fight Song I love it. I would buy it butttt.... i don't have a credit card Its 
inspiring and i sing it in my car and almost hit my dad while he's driving 
and well yeah... "
"I don't know about some people, but, well... Even though ""Fight Song"" seems to ""empower"" people to fight illnesses and 
bullying, that's great! However, if you think about this song a bit 
further, it's simply marketing (which I hope isn't Platten's intentions). 
This song also sounds like your normal, everyday generic pop. I don't know 
about some people, but ""Fight Song"" seems to DE-empower myself, and I 
simply hate this song in general. I have some problems with anxiety, but 
it's not empowering me at all to be confident in public speech or anything. 
I'm not trying to say that this is a bad song, and this shouldn't exist, so 
don't twist my words. This song is just not my taste, and I am not sure 
about how this song empowered other people. Not sure about ""Lone Ranger"" 
though, since no one is talking about it, and I haven't listened to that 
song. "
"I SWEAR IF HATERS GONNA HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE THEN I'M A GONNA BREAK BREAK 
BREAK BREAK THEIR FACE stupid haters *cough cough* nicole Webster *cough 
cough* btw great song "
"Be Strong This a good song I have that song on my mini iPad its good love this song 
every time I hear this song it reminds me about my aunt cause she died of 
cancer every day she will fight cancer but she died she had cancer for a 
long time she fight cancer this reminds me of my aunt if I am sad of 
something or I am sick. Think I am going to. Be sickbfor ever I just hear 
this song it tells me to be strong I love that song I have the song stuck 
in my head some times would sing this song tells you to be strong "
"SUPER AWESOME I love this song because it makes me feel like I can do anything. I've had 
this song stuck in my head for weeks. I like this song stuck in my head!!☺ "
"#Fight song Love this song its really good the first time I heard it it almost made me 
cry and I normally don't cry at all EVER "
"Amazing This song is amazing, and really, inspires people dealing with bullying, 
depression, or even just being sad in general, to feel better about 
themselves and what is going on in their lives. Keep making songs like this 
because they will make people do great things! "
"Just AMAZING!!! It's absolutely beautiful and inspiring! It is a huge inspiration 2 those 
of us with any form of disability mental, or physical! I love it! "
"Fight song Awesome, addictive love it ;) this is my fight song :) $ "
"Nice song Too bad your stealing from your less attentive fans. Buy the songs 
separately, it's more expensive to buy the album... "
"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This song is the next big thing! Love it! Rachel, you are so inspiring to 
everyone! Oh, and a shout out to all you haters out there... you suck!!!!! "
"I really like this song!! I'm on a cross crountry team and I needed a good 
song that's uplifting. This song is perfect!! :) Whenever I'm running I 
listen to this, expecially when I feel like giving up. I really like this 
line: ""My powers turned on , starting right now I'll be strong"". This song 
is AWESOME! "

"Really? So I guess anyone can be a ""star"". All you gotta do is come up with a 
stoopid name, and some ransid lyrics to go with that name, and sing worse 
than me burping, repeat it over and over again, and you will some how get 
your, thing, to be famous? Hmm, guess that woman got it right, somehow. Oh, 
and use a mugshot as your song picture, great idea! "
"Take it back Only someone who has faced or facing something bigger then themselves will 
get this song. Don't stop fighting! "
"<3 This song is so inspiring - it makes me want to stand up & shout 
something! "
"Good They should replace rocky with rachel and instead of eye of the tiger they 
should put her song on instead.Rocky the boxer(movie as in Rocky). "
"Good song but here is advice. It would be cheaper to buy the songs separately. It would only be 2.48 vs 
the album is 2.99 just saved you 52¢ #you'rewelcome "
"I love this song and all u haters i dont think Ratchel cares a thing bout 
wat u think so shut up "
"I love the song, but she's not that great of a singer as she doesn't 
enunciate many of the words such as ""fight"" as I always thought she said 
""fire."" Other than that I love the message that the song is sending "
"I love Fight Song! People say nasty things but she sounds amazing (if I need to say it one 
more time AMAZING!!) She is singing things that matter in life! (Not 
something like a song about boys but things like fighting for what you did) 
I really hope she writes more things like Fight Song! "
"Fight Song This song is so inspiring. Rachel Platten has really outdone herself with 
this AWESOME song! Her music has inspired me and I think she should 
continue to inspire others. #FightSong. "
"I can't even discribe it its like ☺ But she still IS NOT BETTER THEN LUKE 
BRYAN but she is still good "
"So empowering! One of the best motivational songs I've heard since Katy Perry's ""Roar"" "
"The Fight Song I love this song as anyone who has ever seen experienced any long term 
illnesses can relate. Her music expresses the battles as to the every day 
of keeping alive. Inspirational,hopeful with force. Thank you Rachel. "
"Annoyinnnggg before anyone attacks me I know this song has a good and heart warming 
message behind it and its nice but this song is super annoying and it makes 
me want to drown my self in a pool. "
"BEST SONG EVER I was in the car with my family on my diabetic anniversary and this song 
came on and has helped me fight through my disorder and strive with 
confidence instead of walking and felling awful and unimportant. I listen 
to this every day! #life changing. When I bought this song I knew that it 
was money well spent "
"Back to rock even heavier The first album after Bon Scott's death was all it took to get me to be an 
AC/DC fan for life. Still rocks harder 35 years later than many of today's 
rock bands "
"What can I say??? I was going to write a review telling the whole story about how AC/DC are 
the greatest rock n roll band in the world, how they had the greatest 
frontman to ever take the stage Bon Scott. How he died in 1980 and rock 
music took it's worst blow since Hendrix. How the band so nearly decided 
they couldn't continue but carried on and they found a new equally unique 
vocalist, a geordie and his own man who gave it his all and together they 
made a landmark rock album. But I will just say this. Buy it,play it now. "
"EPIC!! Seriously??? Do I need to review this masterpiece at this point? I think 
we all know...at least I hope we do. Buy it today and thank me tomorrow. 
That is all. "
"ACDC-Back In Black My favorite album of all time! (FOR SURE)-WITH ACDC ALBUMS, EVERY SONG 
THAT THEY PUT OUT IS GREAT. I CAN LISTEN TO EACH SONG ON EVERY ALBUM THAT 
HAS BEEN RELEASED, AND THAT IS HARD TO FIND. (WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL IN 
MY 68 CAMARO) THEY ARE (THE BEST!) "
"Back in Black One of the greatest bands and greatest albums ever! Thank you thank you 
AC/ DC for finally letting us ring Hell's Bells and Shoot To Thrill again!! "

"Back in black The mini album l bought for $3.99.doesnt play.when l try a window pops up 
tells me, cannot stream temporarily unavailable. What a waste of money.what

guitar shredder on solo's! "
"There's a reason this album sold 40 million copies it's an comeback with 
the replacement singer Brian Johnson perfect album "
"This is classic rock at its finest. It is highly improbable that any other band will ever surpass what they 
have done. True legends that will never be gone so long as their music is 
still played. Mike and Tim. "
"Paul Alexander Best Album Made There the biggest rock band in the world . Im An AC/DC Fan Seen Them At

guitar/drum rhythms are fantastic, & Angus Young is incredible on lead 
guitar... I just can't sit still, (or not sing along) during at least 99% 
of the songs! If you love rock music, you must have this album in your 
collection, period! "
