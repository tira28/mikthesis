"It's worth one listen. The last 5 songs are the best. Started from the bottom shouldn't have been 
his opening song. Drake isn't a bad boy, and this album seems like a fraud, 
a little. Too Much is my fave track. "
"Excellent! Make no mistake, this is probably the best album of the year tied with J 
Cole. Every album he keeps proving his credibility. Yes he's no Nas, Common 
or Jay-Z. But you can always appreciate his stories, the pain the love the 
loss the bravado. Great replay value, unlike the trash that Kanye put out 
earlier this year. "
"Music to STUNT to. Other than the few lyrics set to past romances, seems Drake went with the 
""F@*£ you I'm rich now"" version of drake, that is ignorant bliss, but its 
understood as he's rapping the life he knows. - Just the market is full of 
such lyrics, would've been nice to have more of a mixture between the woman 
and how they fit the new lifestyle, with the more witty version of Drake 
when he knew his audience would understand. "
"He's real. #NWTS A lot of different pieces to him rolled into this album. You get the loved 
up side, failed romamces, broken family, life lessons he's had to learn, 
and the tougher hiphop side of him all on the one album. Its not the same 
as Take Care cause it takes you to where he is as a person now. Drake will 
aswell be one of my favourite rappers. He's real. Don't expect him to 
sugarcoat anything out here. "
"Drizzy at his best I loved his last album. But this is much better! I can't get enough of 
Tuscan Leather and The Language "
"Moments of magic There are some great parts on this album. However the majority is average. 
Nothing like take care. Similar to yeezus in the sense that sometimes it 
feels like drake just chose complete abstract sounds to sing/rap over( not 
as bad as yeezus). Drake is fantastic a lyrical genius and the if your 
thinking about buying the album you have to weigh lyrical genius against 
abstract sounds. I am in no way a ""true fan"" of drake. Therefore I am 
unbiased. "
"IYRTITL mixtape has been out for a while but i still think this was his 
best album ever. Been a Drake listener/fan or whatever you want to call it 
since Take Care. So, my opinion is this: NWTS and TC were his best albums, 
but NWTS has that little extra. It is worth listening. All songs on this 
record are very good and catchy while on his last mixtape, there's only a 
few I really like. Can't wait for his next album. I'm curious if it will 
top this. -Take Care OVOXO "
"Good Love it.. even the song Worst Behaviour is soo dry, the rest is GREAT! "
"Amazing Drake captures emotions and energy like no other rapper. This album is on 
par with Kanyes Dark Twisted Fantasy "
"Great album but... One of the song ""The Motion"" is not in the deluxe album. Other than that 
its a must buy. "
"Owned it Sounds from his old mixtapes combined with sounds from take care this 
album could not have been made more perfect! "
" Quick Question; Howbis it not avaliable in my county? Where do I live 
UnicornTopia? Tf "
"You wanna get a listen to sampha's 'too much' heard tht first, but drakes 
taken it to the next level "
"Love It Just 1% better than take care, take care is a realllllyyyyyyy reaalllyyyy 
good album & so is this:') "
Hold on were going home I haft to pee just hold on were going home. Love this song lol 
Don't let 'started from the bottom' fool you I really enjoyed this album. 
Toooo beast Well done drake good one 
"Drizzy is a legend Loved the whole album. Go Drake, go! <3 "
"NWTS A must have, who knows, knows and if you don't get to know!! "
"Class! Okay so, yes I may be bias, and he is no young Jay-Z but, the stories and 
emotion, any one can empathize with "
"AWESOME !!! Don't know how drake does it but this album is epic!!!! The motion is not 
on the deluxe copy??? If u like drake buy asap !!! "
Absolutely Fantastic Album Im not one to review music. But I really like this album 
"Not Take Care drake If your expecting the drake who did ""Take care"" and ""Make me proud"" well 
you would be disappointed it seems drake left his softer side and become 
tougher because hip hop didn't take him seriously. . Im really disappointed 
in this album its not drake it seems forced mr tough guy... shame because 
he is a amazing artist "
"Dream of Possession, I'd have my eye on drake. Smooth beat, slow and sexy. Romance of today. He 
never occured to me Untill I was swept away in depth. Old fashioned feel, 
personal. Your made to be desired, melt "
Drake Tuscan leather the motion and pound cake jheeze them songs are hard 
"Perfect Remember this album does come under hip hop aswell as rap, so dont be 
suprised if you get a taste of him singing, cause hip hop does entail 
singing, songs like tuscan, wu-tang, all me, furthest thing, poundcake, is 
the new generation of rap, its not great but its certainly the best 
compared to what you hear from other 'rap' artists today "
"Drake love all his albums theRe great, but love this one even better, he sounds 
even better live, n he's God dam sexy, he just gets better n better xx "
"Incredible album Drake back with another incredible album, he's stepped it up again this 
year, the beats are hard hitting and the lyrics are genius. Not a bad song 
on the album well worth £10. "
"Sameen02 I think this album is the best especially hold on, where going home "
"Beat album I loove this album so much, and I can't choose one song as my fave cause 
it's like a story. "
"It was leaked Album was leaked long time ago. But, its still good especially pound cake "
"Awesome Album Drake is a master story teller, one for the ages "
A Must Have-EPIC★★ SIICKKK ALBUMM..drake went in with this album.♡♥ 
"Amazing. Better than thank me later, not necessarily worse than take care, just a 
different style, but I do prefer take care. NWTS. "
"Sick album Best album by drake in my opininon, love it! "
Drake is just so perfect he's voice is just amazing tbf! 
"Excellent music Looking real sexy, with a amazing voice & Drake's lyrics are out of this 
WORLD!! "
"Unexpected Not his best album, but it's growing on me, first half is quality. In time 
is a tune also. "
Just bloody awesome Awesome beat too 
"Llove I don't usually buy albums but I heard drakes on YouTube and had to have 
it "
"Fantastic compilation I happened across this while browsing, and as I listened to each track on 
this album I was surprised by how many of them I recognised and remembered, 
despite not being familiar with some of the song names. Theres hardly a bad 
one in the bunch. Well worth a purchase, especially at the price. "
"I've owned this CD for years and it's one of the first albums that I've 
repurchased - it's that good. If you're a casual Fleetwood Mac fan like I 
am, you'll really appreciate all the really good music on this album. It's 
got everything you'll want to hear, except ""The Chain"", which I highly 
recommend you download as a single to complete your collection. Happy 
listening! "
"One of the greatest groups... Thank-you. Always loved their music. What an artistic, musically gifted 
group of talent conjoined together. Unique & delightfully quirky... "
"Only giving this 2 stars because you can't listen without an Internet 
connection. Disappointing when I have to turn my data off! "
"Love this album. Reminds me of my mother, she used to love listerning to 
stevie nicks sing for fleetwoodmac. The best "
"Fleetwood Greatest Hits Great album, strong vocals by Stevie Nicks, great memories. "
"One of the best compilation albums ever! The songs on this album are some of the best ever written & performed by 
one of the best bands of all time. Stevie, Christine & Lindsey at their 
peak. "
"Awesome hits! Some of the best, most enduring songs from one of my favorite bands. "
"The Best for sure!!!! I will take this one with me to my grave! One of the greatest best of 
compilations by any band ever! Cannot imagine life without it! "
"Awesome! I have a lot of love for this album, it's 1 of my favorites. "
"My type of music I'm 32 and this is my type of music none of this rubbish u get now.i can 
listen to this all day and stevie nicks is my hero xx "
"Fleetwoodmac Stevie nicks,does an awsome job with Rhiannon. I've loved this band for 
years. You can't go wrong with this band.Fleetwoodmac is One of the 
greatest bands around. "

"Great mellow music Good for the road, you can sing most of the songs by heart. "
"Fleetwood Mac Greatest band to ever perform, if I don't see them before I die, my life 
will have been for nothing "

"Can I give ten stars?? Goosebumps! Truly master's of their art. This music just doesn't date. I'm 
wearing out my speakers listening to it!!!! "
Awesome album Fleetwood Mac greatest hits is great. Highly recommended. 
"Go away 1 its not very good, 2 these are supposed to be weekly deals, not ones 
that last over 3 quarters of a month "
"I'm a 17 year old hipster... That can't get enough of the only music I allow to exist in my mind. That 
music is that of 60's, 70's, and 80's. Now, I know many will disagree, but 
music of today is disgraceful compared to the real music such as Fleetwood 
Mac! My favorite is Dreams, followed by Rhiannon (Best Album: the chain) "
Love the mac. Dreams is my favorite song followed by sara. 
Almost perfect I just can't believe The Chain isn't on here... 
"Never Ending Pleasure. Been listening to this for a very very long time. Always come back to it 
as real music lives for ever! "
Amazing. I'm might be a youngin' but I do love me some Fleetwood Mac!

fans are just making jokes about that they are punk rock. Btw they are NOT

love them so much. ~ Real Bands save Fans real Fans save Bands. ~ "

"Amazingly Awesome!!! Finally our generation has our ""Aretha Franklin"". This girl here will be 
making chart Toppers for years to come. Do your thing girl! "
"Luv dhizz album i bought dhiszz album..... psych i didnt but its really guddd adele is a 
good singer i think she deserved all ha grammy's "
"Breathless I love Adele so much.... Im totally breathless... Every time i hear her 
songs... Its like angels singing in my ears... Well Done Adele .... Five 
Stars "
"Love it!!! This album is so soulful, so deep, and so moving. Adele's talent and range 
with her voice and the emotion she portrays in these songs just makes it 
one of the best albums i've heard in years! As soon as you hear her sing, 
it instantly takes you to another place. Love it!! "
"21 By Adele is record breaking album and has 4 hits and 3 of them are #1 on 
the billboard chart. The album received Adele 6 grammy nominations at the 
2012 grammys and Adele won all 6 grammys. The grammy nominations included 
""album of the year"" and ""Song & Record of the year"" and ""Best Pop Vocal 
album"" etc. 21 debut at #1 on the billboard chart and was #1 for countless 
weeks. Adele suprisingly beat other major artist for the grammy icluding 
artist such as Katy Perry and Rihanna. As you can see , Adele is an amazing 
songwriter and vocalist. "
"Over rated... over played The way Set Fire starts is incredible. The rest of this so called ""music"" 
is just to monotonous. "
"Classic Columbia recordings picked her up on a good deal and made a good choice 
here. Adele has a very classic style voice with a modern theme, such 
throwbacks can be heard from the music in her songs like ""Rumor Has It"" "
"Plain I love Adele but only good songs are Rolling in the Deep,Rumor Has It &Set 
the fire to the rain! the rest to slow or sounds weird "
"It Stinks This is what google calls rock? I found this in the rock section. Second, 
every song on the album stinks. This is not real music with instruments. I 
would know, i'm a musican. I like rock music. Modern rock stinks. Good 
music is about to die. Classic rock is the best. You people should listen 
to some bands like Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Metallica, AC/DC, Def Leppard, 
Guns n Roses, Rush, The Who, and Deep Purple. Those are most of the best 
rock bands. Don't let real music die out! "
"Love this song... This is one of Adele best songs. I cry everytime I hear this song. Keep up 
great job Adele!!!!! KitKat "
"Great Those who gave her a 1 should suck up the facts of life beautifully 
presented by Adele in this album. Such as rumor has it, rolling in the 
deep, turning tables, and someone like you off the top of my head "
"Raw talent More talent in her little pinky than any manufactured poptart on the 
market. This is what REAL singing sounds like!! Most people favor Rolling 
In The Deep, or Set Fire To The Rain, both of which are awesome, but I 
think Someone Like You is her best song. And the best I've heard (so far) 
that really shows her talent. "
"LOVE IT!!! I dont know how some people dont like her but I guess they dont understand 
the things shes gone through and her music is just amazing I love it!! "
"Amazing woman<3 This woman knows how to sing...amazing voice lol wow I love her songs 
makes me tear:') "
"Lol Lot of you keep complaing but i wonder who was the one that one 6 grammies 
and was the star of the year. Oh ya..pft..wait. where else are we... "
"Adel She sings from her heart nd you sure know it . goose bumps all over 
crackin singer "
"Love abandoned She really got to me one this album I am going through it with my husband 
I love dearly ni feel it fading away. She says how I felt "
"Timeless This album falls as a classic for me coming from 2011. It's a great listen 
and chronicles the shades and emotions of dealing with heartbreak and life. 
It may not prove for all but Adele's soulfully enthused voice is far beyond 
her years. I wonder what lies in the future for a talent such as her. "
"100% 5 stars Her album is truly one of a kind. From 1st to the last song very 
captivating!! "
"I Love Adele! My Favorite Artist I have the full album 21 and she is amazing you don't have to buy it here 
you can get it free but my favorite song is Some One Like You and Turning 
Tables...you never get tired of this album best ever in 2011 "
"This sucks!!!!!!:-) You should die if you like her music i will kill myself if i listen you 
are a luser if you like this music so you are a stupid sico if you 
listentoothis to! "
I love Adele & 21! This girl is a beast! One of the best out there! 
"Comnent from lilkhaleesi I love you adel you make music what it use to be and bring my own voice 
out again youve written songs that my life has written out but I never 
could have found wirds to describe the things I felt I swear songs like 
someone like and others were things that described things I felt in life 
thank you And to the person named googleuser stfu and learn diffrent music 
this is defiantly real music some one wrote because they felt something on 
a real stiry they went through have you ever even written music stfu "
"ADELE ""ADELE 21"", her, debut album, for the world. ""Rolling In The Deep"", broke 
all existing, invisible barriers, and reached the core, of music, lovers' 
hearts. Bravely, Adele revealed her soul to us, baring, her innermost 
mysteries of the enigma of love, passion and the destruction, of the 
spirit, of two lovers, who had become one. Adele breached past the forces, 
protecting, the hallowed dwelling of beauty. Adele is the first to enter, 
since Janis Joplin. "
"SERIOUSLY?! YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS YET?! Takes my breath away it is so beautiful. Great album to blast at full 
volume and scream-sing to it rain or shine. "
"Awsome Adele is the best singer of our generation. For all of u idiots that say 
it is fake then go to youtube and watch her live at the Royal Albert hall. 
Adele is amazing. Adele keep up the great work. P.s. the reason she sounds 
deppresed is because she wrote the songs about he ex. For those of you who 
r saying she is depressing she is an insperation. "
"This album has four songs with #1 single potential Even if you've been beaten to death with ""Rolling in the Deep"" or ""Someone 
like you"" more recently, you should know that Adele carries that quality 
throughout the entire album. ""Set Fire to the Rain,"" ""Turning Tables,"" and 
""One and Only"" could easily climb today's pop dominated charts just as 
well. Adele's 21 is a real evolution from her 19 album. I'd strongly 
recommend the album "
"Terrible I have not heard worst it is sad irritating and annoying does she ever 
stop tell her to do something else go back to school or something "
Leydi garcia I love her songs...they are beutiful lyrics... sad but nice.. 
"Adele is amazing Her voice is so powerful i'm sick of the majority of modern""music"" as it 
consists of love drugs (sex) and other stuff modern life has just become 
based on greed and other inappropriate needs so glad she can sing from her 
heart :-) "
"WOW So my best friend is getting married and I'm her wedding singer.. and i 
have to sing this whole album.. i couldnt top her if i tried shes amazing i 
love her so much!! Shes my inspiration adn everything.. :)) "
"CYNTHIA. M. LOVE YOU! ADELE! YOU ARE. A BEAUTIFUL! TALENTED, AN. WONDER - FILLED! 
WOMAN! LOVE YOU ALWAYS! CYNTHIA CINDY MASHBURN ROSSER-SHAY "
"In love with all Adel songs! She has such an amazing voice that touches you in the most unique way. 
Great job! Love the downloads! "
"Adele Is AWESOME Adele is truly a talent to remember. I am at a loss for words. There is no 
precise way to explain how magnificent Adele is. "
"Outstanding! Adele is the best blues vocalist of the last 20+ years. She goes from raw, 
gut-wrenching soul to beautiful ballads. "
"I love adele Adele is amazing.doesnt matter what mood I am I always listen to adele. 
she is beast. my favorite song from her is the fire to the rain and I love 
it so much like I listen to it like everyday. love you ADELE!! "
"Lov it You dumb stupid idiots that don't like her music are retarded especially 
kaydence storm you retarded idot you shut you punk mouth you probably like 
Miley Cyrus better than Adele Miley Cyrus sucks she sings about stupid 
things Adele sing abou things that are not gross so shut up 
idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
"Great voice Adele is a great artist. Beautiful voice.. I love it & my kids love it.. 
don't understand why the album is marked explicit on here.. it is far from 
that. "
"to EWWBLAW?(SP) u haven't a clue, poor thing..Adele is AMAZING, UNIQUE AND WORTH LISTENING 
TO, EVERY NOTE, EVERY LYRIC ! "
"Absolutely perfect!!! She has a BEAUTIFUL voice and a wonderful range! Definitely one of the 
best artists of today! "
"Not really a big room fan... Pretty good album, I brought 18 months which got me into Calvin Harris. 
I'm more of a Dubstep/house fan but HATE bigroom. But on a whole, the album 
is actually awesome "
"Best album from him I think that his a genius and that all the songs on that album has so much 
meaning and a nice and great story behind it! He has some sick beats and 
you cant get enough of any of them! Adore this album. **bought it** "
"Motion This Album Is Epic Well Done Calvin Harris ""My Favrioute Song On This 
Album Is Blame, Outside (Feat. Ellie Goulding) And Open Wide (Feat. Big 
Sean) I Think This Album Could Go To Number 1 in the Album Chart With 
Jameela Jamil This Sunday Coming up. Well Done Calvin Harris."" "
"Really disappointed The only song I like is 'outside' and some others like summer that came 
out before and are old now... "
"Phenominal With songs like faith, under control, summer, blame, outside, open wide, 
together, dollar signs and burning Calvin Harris has yet again produced 
some more smash hits.18 months was great, but motion is even better! "
What... I Created Disco and Ready for The Weekend were classics. This is trash. 
"Not great I usually like his songs but in this album they aren't great. Summer, 
Blame and Outside are the only good songs, the rest aren't good at all. 
Disappointing "
"A Nice Change from his Last Album I was surprised by how much I liked this album, it has a nice mix of 
different house styles and a variety of talented artists he worked with. 
All in all its pretty darn good. "
"Lockett429 This album is spectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love Outside, Faith, 
Under Control, Blame and Burnin!!!! Calvin Harris you outdid yourself with 
this!! Love it!! And to people who dont like it... Dont comment and ruin 
the vibe.. This album is great! "
"My new temporary number 1 song is on this album. Outside is awesome! I love Ellie Goulding! My music collection grows 
rapidly, so my number 1 song will change rapidly. :) "
"Don't really listen to any of calvins songs but ""outside"" When they first put this on i actually payed attention. The beat is really 
good "
"Pointless & dull Only songs I liked was outside, blame & open wide, the rest of it was like 
wtf is this....so boring & a waste of time! "
"AMAZING! THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME SCREW ALL THE HATERS WHO DON'T LIKE THIS BECAUSE 
THIS IS SICK OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW MUSIC "
"Awesome track I don't care what anyone says calvin harris is awesome and makes the most 
awesome beats "
"Great Sound! Outside is the albums best track but i find it to sound very similar to 
Harris's song Let's Go. Blame also sounds similar to Sweet Nothing & Summer 
sounds extremely similar to Feel So Close. I will say the formula works and 
this album is awesome. I'm a huge Calvin Harris fan and I think his sound 
is creative and catchy. never thought he would work with big sean honestly. "
"Love the song but It should NOT say free than when you click on it it says payment method 
that isn't right don't advertise it as free if it is not "
"Perfect album ❤ 12/13 Gwen Stefani & Big Sean OUTSIDE i will replay this song all night 
long... "
Best album yet u defo owtdun guetta Gets u in the partymode class too listen too before going owt xx 
"Motion! I can listen to the whole album; good mix of chill and pump songs from 
Harris. "
Dance The best of both worlds largest selection of new things in my life 
"Excellent dance music This guy sure is talented. Great dance music. Slow acid, under control are 
awesome. "
"Problems... For some reason i didnt have enough space to download it so i can only 
listen to it with wifi WTP "
"This is the best music I ever listened too if you don't like this music 
your crazy!!!! "
"Awesome Great record with soul, energy, awesome beats and magnificent 
collaborators. 5 out of 5 "
"love this album there's a few old but still great songs plus there's also awesome new 
songs that I can't get out of my head "
"Awesome Summer is starting to get old, but the rest is golden. Can't wait until it 
moves off the 'first listen' lists and into my library. "
"Ehhh Might take a few listens to grow on me, but so far, not a fan. Some good 
songs but most are skippable. ICD, RFTW, and even 18 Months were great 
albums, but this one seems to try too hard and fails miserably. "
Great album! See you at Hakkasan for new year's eve :-). 
"Motion Very well put album, several songs soothing to my ears.... "
"AMAZING I absolutely love the song summer. I listen to it all of the time and it 
doesn't get boring. I haven't listened to many of the other songs but I bet 
they are amazing too!☺ "
Calvin harris Love calvin Harris me fav songmis out side xx 
I just saw him at DOTD! Love every track. Especially Ecstasy and Faith. <3 
"Like most of it. They are all really good tracks. Not a big fan of ecstasy. And love now is 
not really Calvin's style. It sounds like something clean bandit would do "
"Best Album yet! ♡ I'm a huge fan of Calvin and no doubt you can see he put a lot of effort 
and energy in making this extraordinary Album. So show him some love by 
buying this Album! "
"Just gets better and better!!! Calvin Harris has done it once again... What a great album.. Keep up the 
great work... "
"Trash Just a bunch of pop and big room. Calvin Harris is a good producer when he 
actually tries "
"It paid off I've been waiting long enough fir calvin harris's 2nd album and it's 
really worthy "
"So awesome This is the best song in the world. Well that's my opinion is. It's OK if 
you don't think so "
It is my favourite song is outside and summer . It's epic 
"Beautiful Calvin Harris is so genius on how he approaches dance music, every song 
makes you feel different emotions! Awesome! "

after this album dropped.....she sucksssssss "
"Country Music is Badass Again! Every single song on this album takes me back to a time in country music 
where everything was genuine & relatable. The songs are catchy and tell 
stories within themselves. It's clear she's the new queen of country music! "
"Fantastic album Brilliant. Country at is modern best. Every listen creates a new favourite 
track "
Miranda Such a good artist. I couldnt ask for anyone better 
"Something Bad is the Bomb I love this song I would sing it 24/7 if I could my favorite song. Miranda 
Lambert is my favorite artist fallowed by Carrie Underwood. Love it! "
"Love Miranda sticking to classic country Miranda is real talent. The guy that gave her a 1 and iggy izalia a 5 is 
an idiot "
"Miranda!!!! Omfg there isn't a song she can't sing that's all I gotta say. 
But this is a amazing album! "
"She is such an amazing artist. Miranda never fails to impress me. Miranda 
and Carrie are both amazing female singers on Somethin' Bad. I absolutely 
love Automatic and Platinum and Somethin' Bad. "
Smoking and drinking Loved it good song reminds me of my two daughters dad...long time ago

"Platinum Miranda just keeps us on our toes.Wonderful article about Miranda and her 
new look in Maire Claire magazine! "
"Miranda lambert She has put words to songs that we all feel, with the old country ho down 
an new beat together she's got something going on with words music like 
I've never heard. With magic . "
"Won't sync I bought the song, had to create a Google play account, I get that done, 
it said waiting for music to sync, I left it waiting all night and it still 
hasnt synced, I'm very disappointed considering I bought it to listen 
offline. . "
"AAWWEESSOOMMEE Mranda Lambert is the best singer in da world to find more stuff like this 
find Carrie Underwood "
Yesss Put miranda lambert together with carrie underwood and you get a hit 
"Great as always except for one thing Miranda Lambert is talented and unique and believe me, it was great. But I 
wish it didn't sound so mainstream music ish. That's just my opinion 
though. Otherwise great album. "
"Pink pistal Ya you show him what the pink pistal about..lol love ya music...you look 
happy.. "
This album gets me through a long road of traveling...love her voice! 
Platinum She puts a lot of work into all of her song! Which are great! 
Something bad Love it it is got a good beat and I love her 
"Smokin' and drinkin' <3 my favorite song! <3 thanks miranda! I'd love to meet u too. :-) (a 
girl can only dream) "
"Country at its best Another great album by Miranda that balances her butt kicking attitude 
with her softer side. Love it ! "
"Ok First off, I never would expect her to release an absolute bullshit song 
like Something Bad. It was awful. She sounds so fake in this album. It's 
just disappointing. "
"Wanna be country I live in the South and if I had a quarter for ever time a girl said she 
was Southern, Country, or a belle I would be a billionaire. Almost all of 
them are fake wannabes just like this trash album. "
"Love her new album!! I heard the whole album once. I can't wait to listen to it over and over 
again! Classic Miranda! "
SHE IS AWSOMEE LOVER THE SONG SOMTHIN BAD AND MAMMAS BROKEN HEART!!! She is the best along with carrie Underwood

Lil red wagon Love it she's my favorite singer 
"Love it! Love the song little red wagon. Also love Gravity's a b**ch. I 
recommend pricila and automatic. "
"Doesn't work (update) Would love it if it'd download I'm sure. All it says is error and that 
it's processing. Google says it'll be available in a few minutes but it's 
been at least 4 hours. Will keep this updated. (Update) works after about 2 
days "
"usahou I know this seems unfair and I really like his music, but I got the email 
to download his album for free? Free is free, it means ""doesn't cost 
anything"" so why is there any need for any payment info. or prices on 
everything???? This review is not really a reflection on Michael Bublé 
works at all but more on the Google Play email and how it appears. Now, I 
did not click on or go forward with this, so it might be that it charges 
all this stuff and then gives you a credit at the end which makes the cost 
zero. But, it doesn't say that so the comments do say STAY AwAY, AND THAT 
IS WHAT I DID. Sorry Google Play, if you are trying to be nice and offer 
something for free make it truly free. "
"Thank you for beautiful music!! For those skeptics about this being a scam, it really is NOT a scam. Yes, 
they do ask for credit card info or PayPal, but they never charge you. I 
download a lot of their free albums and never had problems. I've never been 
wrongfully charged for anything I didn't purchase by my own free will and 
authorization. This is a beautiful gift from google and Michael. Thank 
you!! "
"Christmas In a Wonderful Way Michael has always had a very unique take on Traditional music and this 
collection is no different, it shows the same grace and command of skill he 
has shown before. Thanks Michael this is a great gift and Merry Christmas 
to you too!! "
"Thanks for your beautiful free music, in the Christmas Spirit . I have always loved Michael Buble music and voice talent. Better than any 
of the Voice contestants or american idle. Keep singing, god has given you 
a real gift to share with the world. Merry Christmas Michael Buble' and 
hope to continue to hear your classical voice through the air ways by any 
means that it may fill the hearts of all of us for many years to come. "
"Thanks for free music! I haven't listened to it yet, but these are my favorite Christmas 
classics. I'm sure I'll love it as long as he can sing haha! For those 
worrying about whether or not it's free, the way Google play is set up you 
have to ""buy"" things. But the price is $0.00. You can put 1 cent on your 
account and be able to get this album. I've never entered my credit card 
info on Google play, only Google play cards. So stop being cheap and put 
some money on your accounts! "
"Thanks for the free albums google To all people complaining that they ask for your credit card info: this is 
done because you have to press buy to get the album but the price is zero. "
"Great album Reviews are supposed to be about the product not your opinion of the 
company, but in response...this is the 10th free album I've gotten from 
Google and I've never been charged for something I wasn't purchasing. Your 
credit card is requested for any ""purchase"". When you ""buy"" the album you 
get an email receipt for $0.00. Calm down. Every store keeps track of your 
information so if you're that terrified and susceptible to fear mongering 
go get some CASH and actually but the album for $10 in a physical store. "
"Great Holiday Album. I'm not much of a Bublé fan but this is a great holiday album to have 
especially if you're able to get it when it's free. It's a very easy 
Christmas album to listen and relax to. I read a few of the other 
reviews... if you're not familiar with Google play or are using it for the 
first time, of course you're required to give payment information for 
purchases like music and books even if they're free. That really isn't a 
big deal... don't bring those kinds of issues into the reviews. "
"Brilliant album Don't usually like christmas albums but I LOVE this album probably helps 
being a big buble fan but its brilliant guaranteed to get you festive "
"Amazing! I'm 12 and I LOVE his music! He adds a unique touch but keeps it classic 
so everybody can love it!:) "
"Great Album and artist! Only a talented artist can make me love Christmas music. For those saying 
scam, you have to have a payment option attached to your Play account, even 
for free stuff. If you are worried about it, go pick up a pre-paid Visa/MC 
or use an empty PayPal. I have had an active Play account for years and 
have never received an unauthorized charge. "
"Amazing (: Love michael buble.. and this album is amazing the vocals are just lush! 
Ahh just brriliant! :) "
"Link doesn't work I was so excited to get this free download and when I tried, the link is 
stating to pay full price. I was so looking forward to hear Buble's 
Christmas CD. "
"Its free, not a scam Thank you for the music!! To you people that can't understand how this 
works, let me clue you in. This and many other things on Google Play are 
completely FREE!! If you a Play account already, then they have your credit 
card info. Click the button and its added to your account. Free, no charge 
to your account. If you haven't set up your account, yes they do want 
credit card info for future purchases. This is the 3rd completely free 
album I've received. Quit being a bunch of Negative Nancys!! "
"Why are people stupid When Google offers a free CD its freaking free! The credit card info goes 
on file for your Google wallet. If you already have one set up like 
millions of people do then they dont ask for it on the free giveaways... 
Get a life. Get a job. And stop worrying.... nobody wants your ebt cards "
What a treat! Lovely! Thanks for all the holiday songs from a classy talented artist! 
"I love this album he got amazing voice. I listen to the video on youtube and loved it. 
perfect voice and tunes for the holiday. bought it to help supports the 
artist.Tyvm for having this wonderful album for such a wonderful price. 
Happy holiday to everyone. have a safe holiday. "
"Wish people would stop lowering ratings Just because google asks for information. I bought past apps so I have to 
enter my info anyway. Anyhoo, stop ruining people's ratings because of your 
own paranoia. /// I avoid the radio but it is quite nice to listen to 
Christmas music once in a while. "
"Larry Davis It is free. They have to have some kind of account. If you bought a google 
play card and redeemed it, then you would be able to get it and see that it 
charges you absolutely nothing. It is not a scam. "
