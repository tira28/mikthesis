"Didn't want to like it but can't help it... Whatever you think about EDM (or whatever neo hipster genre you want to 
call this) there is no denying that this guy can write a catchy tune. Whole 
album is just so easy to listen to and isn't trying to be overly 
prentenious like many modern albums of this nature. Play it loud and proud. "
Awesome I loved the song dangerous I also like the others sooooooo cool 
"Great. Great. No, amazing. I could listen to this forever. Well maybe not forever "
Sick album David's just the best DJ ever 
"Definitely my summer jam. I can't stop listening, it caught me on the second listen so I recommend 
you download it. "
I don't like too much I love David Guetta music but this album is not my favorite. 
"Listen I got this album to LISTEN to hey mama dangerous rise goodbye friend 
lovers on the sun and bad and what I did for love has become my favourite "
Love love Love this new album! My favorite song from it is rise and hey mama 
"Love it! Love all of them, most favorite ones are, Lovers On The Sun and Shot Me 
Down. Great Album. "
"Favourite EDM Album I can't stop listening to these songs; the music is good and David Guetta 
has done really well. One of my favourite EDM (or whatever genre you want 
to call it) albums. "
"Guettastic,Guettabulous Its no wonder other stars in d music heavens love his music!U cud listen 
to his feelgood music forever! "
"Not free hey mama OH MY GOD I WANTED THE HEY MAMA MA MA BECAUSE IT MY FAVORITE SONG AND ITS 
NOT FREE! "
I am youtuber Why I fell so good? so good so got na 
It's okay. I'm not a big fan of David Guetta 
"Sigh.. Dangerous is an amazing song, but the album as a whole is more than 
disappointing "
Listen by David Guetts His new album is as good as his last one. 
"Can't stop playing it! I wake up with 'Bang my head' and 'No money no love' echoing from my 
dreams. Really happy uplifting dance about the house. Awesome! "
Love hey mama Hey mama and dangerous are good 
"His new work is bland nothing special , lawl at Ben best albums ever "
Its ok ! Good compilation of singers . Its ok but not great. 
"Actual song writing It's like david realised that to be more than a novelty act there needed 
to be substance to this . Some of the best artists around writing songs 
here ... Ryan tedder emelie sande Danny script . Just one thing next time 
don't try to please everyone .. drop old mcnaj and don't bother with Miss 
dynamite . "
LOVE all songs All of the songs or a blast too listing to where ever you are 
I hace already preordered on my iTunes account No doubt no excitation for this album 
"Lazy songs One of the worst albums I've heard, lazily made and boring lyrics. "
Killin' It!!! David Guetta made me fall in love with electronic music 
The song is so cool I think it is so coll so 5 stars 
David guetta Love it even better album than nothing but the beat 2.0 that was good 
Awesome Dangerous is so awesome 
Awsome The best music is Dangerous 
Dangerous Its a cool song 
"Cool music Sun Goes Down, Bang My Head, Hey Mama, Dangerous, Goodbye Friend and Lift 
Me Up are the best songs on the album "
"Outstanding album from start to finish Every song is great and some are absolutely off the scale, such an amazing 
compilation of singers/tracks, despite the price tag this is a must have 
album. My favourite song on the album is DG and Sia, the Whisperer. "
"Sooooo Good I love how he uses different styles and experiments my favourite is Hey 
mama gets me dancing every time "
Omg. . . I love this. Especially hey mama! Do more with Nicki!!!! 
Lol I got it for 99p Love ya david 
DG rocks! Always a pleasure listening to this guy! 
I'm absolutely in love with Lovers On The Sun David Guetta is the best DJ EVER!!!!! 
"Rate the album not the FREE purchase process!! Not bad. Typical Blake. A lotta sap mixed in with some fun. Although Neon 
Light was the anthem of my younger days. A little better than some of the 
corporate country being put out these days. Go see Blake live if you get 
the chance, he puts on a fun show. "
"Hey Stupid people Must read terms , must have credit card on file! How's it false 
advertising? When it's clearly stated , Dorks!! I keep a Green Dot card on 
my Google play account and have money transfer to it each month. That way 
none my real info is attached an I can use my Google wallet to buy stuff 
off Google play. "
"It's seriously free.. I have an old debit card with 80 cents on it I've been using for months 
for the free albums of the week (because what am I going to be able to buy 
with that much change?) & guess how much money is on that card after using 
it about 10 times? 80 cents! It doesn't take money. Trust me. I was uneasy 
also that's why I used this one just to be on the safe side. No taxes or 
anything. Legit free albums! "
"Am I the only one I never have a problem with the free album.. I just click free and it 
downloads all the songs for me.. maybe I had a card already on file but 
it's never asked for anything.. "
"Shut up about the Credit card information Most places require credit card information, even for free items. Get over 
it. Be happy they offer decent music for nothing. "
"Awesome I love this album. It is free. It's just Google play is kind of weird and 
wants some money on your account. But it's totally free. You can always 
just get a $10 gift card for your account. "
"Meh Not free if I have to give credit card info where it CLEARLY state select 
method of payment. I really truly enjoy Blake Shelton and wish I could have 
gotten this. The 5 star is for my man, not this service. "
"Love Neon Lights. Buzzing and Lips Taste Like Sangria GREAT. Not asked for 
credit card information just clicked FREE and it downloaded. "
"Free? I got charged $0.00 Woah, ""false advertising""... I just got a receipt for $0.00! Buncha 
clowns, it doesn't charge you..... You come to Google play store with no 
card on file or wallet acct... Why are you here? I guess looking for 
freebies... Typical "
"free why on earth would you need to add a credit card if its free...... man 
whats up with companies they say free then they what your bank, card or 
life history. no thanks free . i love Blake, but you are not getting my 
info...... LOVE AND GREAT WISHES TO BLAKE . "
"For all the complaints Yes you need a credit card on file with google. No it does not charge your 
card.. this is standard procedure for most companies in case you decide to 
make a purchase that is not free. If you aren't realizing that then you 
must not read terms and conditions either. I love this album though. Blake 
Shelton has great music. "
"Need my girl Awesome song! Like all his other songs..he truly is as amazing as he 
looks! Way 2 go Blake I can always expect nothing but the wow factor from 
u.U r The Voice "
"Love it I Love Blake's music. For all of those who are complaining about a credit 
card all you have to do is redeem an app store card on your account and 
have atleast $0.01 on your account and it let's you download all free 
songs. It's not a big deal people. "
"Free album of the week Quit complaining about needing a credit card. You will need a credit or 
debit card, it only needs at least $.01 and a lot of places require a card 
even if it's free. Go buy a five dollar prepaid card and store it on here. 
I however love love love the free albums of the week, it's introduced me to 
some great new music that I never would of thought of buying, now that I 
know if I like it, I can buy other songs or albums from the featured 
artist. Thank you Google play!! "
"Love it. Thanks google No reason not to give five stars. Great artist. And can complain about 
free. Wait, it charged me $0.00 lol "
"You people are dumb If it says free its free if not google would be sued for a ton of money. 
I've been getting the free album of the week for months and not a single 
charge "
"The law requires a purchase This has to be the first time I've seen the review section flooded with 
""why"" comments. There are laws regarding music being illegally downloaded. 
To ensure the music is legally acquired, it must be ""purchased."" Even if 
free, Google is ensuring you have a receipt and their system requires a 
credit card for purchases. As others have said, there are ways around the 
credit card issue. Easiest is to get a Google Play gift card and put it in 
the system. I'm not a huge country fan, but my kids like Blake Shelton 
because of The Voice. And free is a great price to let them have some music 
of his. "
"Awesome free. NOT A SCAM Credit card is only needed to insure you are an actual account 
owner/holder. They charge nothing to it. It is to insure that the DEVICE 
and it's owner are not some BOT program aimed to scrape or, collect FREE 
things like this. It also is to prevent children from downloading things 
that may or may not be allowed. Google is in no way charging your card. It 
is so they can generate a record of transaction with a HUMAN being. And, 
also to help the record label learn who was interested. Market research. "
"It's free stop complaining people I don't like contry music that much but I 
love the fact that they give away a free album every week "
"It really is free... Google always asks for a card number, but they won't charge you. You can 
always set your Google account to charge your phone bill and not enter a 
credit card. All these people rating this album at 1 star because they're 
too incompetent to figure this out is absurd! Great album BTW, love all of 
Blake's music! "
"Blake Shelton.... How can you not love this? Sure brings back the sunshine even if you are 
not a country music fan...you can't go wrong with this! Thanks Google 
Music!!!! "
"Great music from Blake Blake at his best. What more can you ask for?!? Free and Blake...although 
I'm sure Google paid a hefty fee to Blake and all the other singers who get 
listed free on Google Music. And for the people complaining that it's not 
free, just sign up for a Google Music account and place your credit card on 
file! You can't beat the weekly free music. I've been on Music since it 
started and absolutely love it. Prices are often cheaper here than anywhere 
else. "
"Great Album Love this album, also the morons giving it one star about the credit card 
thing are violating play store terms. The ranking is solely for the 
artistic content. Please take ten minutes like I just did and click the 
thumbs up/down button next to each of these stupid reviews and click 
unhelpful, then click again and click spam. "
"Amazing I love all of his songs and it is amazing that he used adas water tower as 
the album photo I love how he throws in Oklahoma into his work "
"Free It is free people. They have to have your credit card because this album 
is not in the free section it is technically a payed product that the 
purchase amount is zero for a limited time. They send you a receipt too, it 
is NOT a scam. It's simple common sense. For those that understand that 
enjoy! For those that don't oh well you miss out. "
"Nice!! (Aside: Peeps - Review the Album - Not your failure) Great album and song selection! Thank you to the artists for agreeing to 
this. I'm more than a little annoyed that people are giving it 1-2 stars 
because they don't know how to follow directions. If you have an iPhone, 
tough luck. You can afford to pay for the album on the iTunes store. If 
you're not set up with google wallet, then why are you even on Google Play? 
Just put the number in, it won't be charged. If you're concerned about 
money download ""Google Opinion Rewards"" hope for some surveys and earn play 
store credit. I'm at ~$10 of free play store credit. Bottom line, stop 
whining. "
"Great artist, great music! Great album... Not ""popped"" up like country has been turning into lately. 
Reminds me of albums from the 90s. Just great tunes! And, it's free this 
week! What's there to complain about?! Now some random emojis... BY THE 
WAY... 4 THOSE SAYIN IT'S A SCAM IF U HAVTA ENTER A CC #.... CHOOSE TO BILL 
YER PHONE BILL, U'LL NEVER B CHRGD (AS LONG AS IT'S A FREE DOWNLOAD) U CAN 
ALSO PASSWORD PROTECT THAT ""BILLING"" SO NO ""ACCIDENTS"" HAPPEN. Google has 
to keep people from phishing these items somehow. "
"Bringing Back the Sunshine This is a great album! Blake has really poured his heart and soul into 
this work. Every song speaks volumes and tells more than just a 
story...Thanks Blake, I appreciate your all-in commitment to this work. "
"For all of you whining about adding a credit card Like someone stated, rate the ALBUM not the PURCHASE PROCESS. It is not a 
scam or advertisement. Just simply how most systems work, you can't 
purchase free apps on iTunes without a credit card. I've never had a 
problem with google having my credit card info. You might even have the 
option to ""charge"" it to your phone bill. Which will be $0.. Maybe look 
into google surveys, where they give you a few cents for a few questions. 
You accumulate it to buy things which I use to buy free stuff as well. "
"Great Man, Great Music Thank you once again for giving a great album out..and you show routinely 
that you are better then Itunes.. for just this. You guys rock It's 
**Free** they require payment in case you want to buy something else.. why 
should they cater to you when they are giving current top music out. Cheryl 
the world doesn't stop.. just for you.. go buy a prepaid card and see -You 
dont get charged for **Free ** Stuff "
"Other free albums have gone into my google music app, this one didn't. I 
can only listen through play store. How can I get this album to go to the 
google music app as well? "
"Pam Banks Vado Everything Blake Shelton sings is really good but each and every song on 
this album is unequivocally his best of his best. I love all the songs 
pamvado@yahoo.com "
"OMG, Why do I like this? I found out this was free, and I figured ""what the hell, I'll download 
it."" I listen to rock, alt rock, indie, a touch of screamo/emo, metal, 
stuff like that. This album, I really like. He's just so friendly and has a 
great voice. Plus, I love his personality. He was great on SNL and I get a 
kick out of him on The Voice. Get this album...you won't be disappointed. "
"Dear Idiots who can't wrap their heads around FREE, It's a pity that there are people who dilute and obscure the philosophy 
and effectiveness of android, freedom, and artists by dishing out poor 
ratings based on nothing but their own ignorance and apathy. Google 
requires that you have an account set up to utilize their FREE music 
through Google play, and having an account requires Google Wallet. You can 
get FREE e-books, games, music, and movies on this fashion, and will not be 
charged for anything unless you press a button that displays a ""$"" and 
number. "
"THANK YOU! I look forward to hearing all the new tuneage from a good ole boy who was 
country before country went rock n roll. ""Ole Red"" is still a fave. 
Young'uns know this music I'm speaking about as ""honky tonk"" or ""western"" 
music w/e that is. I know it by 1 name.... ""good"". All you people whining 
about the CC, I've rec countless free music and not once been charged for 
anything. Like a ho, Google wants to be paid 1st and I would too if you 
stole from me! So shaddup already and say THANK YOU like you were raised! "
"Sleepy, Enjoyable And Consistent, But Not Standout Blake and his team have put together an album of consistent tone and with 
calm pacing. This is enjoyable, but I only found the standout songs to be 
Bringing Back the Sunshine, Just South of Heaven, Good Country Song and 
Just Gettin' Started. It's a little sleepy. I do admit that I'm not a big 
fan of Blake as compared to other artists, so accept the review as just one 
person's opinion. But still a few good hits and voice too. "
"Stfu God forbid you have to make an account to download a CD. A free CD. That 
you can do off of a site online. Y'all are idgits. Now go away. "
"He does it again. Thank you, BS; another amazing album. If I had to pick a single favorite 
track: Anyone else. But, I like them all. "
"Love Me Some Blake! All you people complaining about needing a credit card for a ""free"" 
item...GET OVER IT! It's the world we live in, good grief! Either get the 
free item as instructed or DONT! Love me some Blake Shelton ALL DAY LONG! "
"Love it I love Blakes music. I'm so happy this album is the free. To all the 
people complaining because its asking for a credit card, they just want to 
make sure you're a real person and they are not going to take any money out 
of your account. you can try it with a gift card. It is totally free. Thank 
you once again Google for the free album. "
Love this guy Great music :-) 
"A.L.L.A. This was wayyy different than what I expected. Not very like the old A$AP 
Rocky but this is pretty good. All the tracks on here are not anything like 
what I've heard before. I feel that the songs in this album are best 
listened to together. I can't believe I've replayed some of these songs 
over 100 times since day 1. 11/10 everyday "
"Wow Straight blown away by this flow, A$Ap Rocky did his thing on this album, 
anyone who doesn't think so needs to reevaluate your outlook on music. "
"I'm so late.. I am a bit older, I am the hip hop generation from the beginning and this 
dude is the TRUTH... I'm blown away! "
"ASAP ROCKY THE BEST IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW. THE ALBUM IS AMAZING START TO 
FINISH. THE LYRICS ARE MEANINGFUL AND THE BEATS ARE TOO GOOD. DEFINITELY 
WORTH THE LONG WAIT. THIS ALBUM COULD NOT GO UNDER 5 STARS. 
AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP "
Finally a good album from u Always had the talent but usually pushed ou5 crap but dis is a good one 
"Unoriginal Asap Rocky has a great flow but a lot of the material in this album is 
very unoriginal.... Asap rocky is trying to hard to have that underground 
vibe....& I can't believe Bones from SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ decided to do a 
chorus for Canal st...reason why I say that is because Bones has a lot of 
potential & he had shown that through these years & Asap basically stole 
that originality from the underground scene...I'm rating 3 because I 
appreciate the trying aspect of being ""different"" but its just bland & 
unorigina "
"Love it As far as the new generation of hip hop artist, ASAP is doing his thing. 
Flow, beats lyrics we watching a great artist in the making "
"Grade: B+ (Favorite Tracks: Holy Ghost; Canal St.; LPFJ2; Electric Body; 
Max B; Pharsyde; Wavybone; West Side Highway; M's; Dreams (Interlude); 
Everyday; Back Home // Least Favorite: L$D; Better Things) I really love this project. The song sound great. They are slow paced, I 
know. But I feel as though that they were what Long Live A$AP should have 
been. The features were great. Lil Wayne snapped and I DO MEAN SNAPPED!!! 
But others, like Kanye, had me worried. But overall, this was a good album. "
"Thank you At first I hated the album because It was not what i expected. The mixtape 
and the first album are banggers. I've listened to the new album about 14, 
15 times in the course of the week. I love it, love it. If you don't like 
something on the first time around try it from a different perspective. 
You'll surprise youself. "
"An awaking! The fact remains that this kid is legit. He discussing the truth of his 
life to the masses; and flows aboutnlife as he's lived it and viewed it. 
Skål!!!! "
"D+ (Yes, I gave it a 9.75/10. But that was on first listen...) The more and more I listen to this the more and more I seriously don't see 
why I loved this. But if you do that's GREAT. Ignore me. In my opinion, 
this album is worse than Long.Live.A$AP. When it started with Holy Ghost I 
thought that this is going to be a step up from his first album. When it 
hit Canal St. that's when I thought that that will become factual. But 
where A$AP lost me was Fine Whine. And after that, it was just bad except 
for a couple of songs..... "
"Over all it was an OK album...not terrible by any means.... This album has pretty good intro songs to the album but I feel as if he 
doesn't have much ambition for this album. He doesn't have much versatility 
to keep this album interesting(don't get me wrong it is a good album 
unfortunately most tracks grabbed my attention in the beginning but lost it 
towards the end of the tracks.) . Honestly it didn't live up to it's hype, 
wasn't a great follow up to his early projects. The downfall on this is 
that most tracks on this project are very forgettable. Overall 4/10 "
"Another 4 star album. This year is great for rap music. Asap has done 
something nobody expected from us: meaningful lyrics. The production on 
pretty much all these joints is stellar. It is relaxed and jazzy with the 
hard hitting beats you expect from Asap. This album seems much more drugged 
out compared to Long Live and Live Love but the production is his best yet, 
his flow is one of the best in the game, and he is stepping up lyrically. 
The album easy to play in the car. Some tracks are a miss for me though 
such as fine whine, Lsd, and one other joint I can't remember. First of 
all, a song with future can't be good, second it seems like Lsd is 
impossible to listen to. His ""love"" story is intriguing but it feels to 
claustrophobic and uncomfortable to enjoy. This album is my favorite asap 
album to date and is not what I expected. I say it is half a star up from 
Long live and miles better than love live. Asap is making the radio come to 
him "
"Favorite album of the year I didn't think I'd love this album as much as I do, I liked all Rocky's 
older stuff, but the dark production and everything he raps about makes 
this the best thing he's ever done, at least for me. "
"Alright , did not live up to the hype Honestly thought rocky was gonna go harder in this album, not disappointed 
but not satisfied. What killed this album for me was that Lil Wayne was in 
"" M'$ "" but I give it 3 out of 5. I felt rocky should had given us way more 
since he took a two year break, but this album didn't reach the standards 
in my opinion. "
"Weak Can't stay awake listening to this album, always ends up sending me to 
deep sleep. Hiphop should grab my attention from beginning to end and this 
failed to do so, some tracks were dope tho. "
"Amazing! From the 1st track to the last track, this album is exactly that, 
an album. NY rappers have been under fire for some time due to the lack of 
the ""NY sound"" but I have to say, there are tracks on ALLASAP That do come 
w/ outside flow however (today) sounding NY is more so just NOT sounding 
like you're from the more known regions. Holy Ghost sounds like it could 
have came out in 2001. Check out Canal St, Max B, just to name a few. I 
think this album also warrants Rocky not just a hit maker but a true 
artist; a true lyricist. FYI: All you reviewers who stated they only like 3 
tracks , you're just listening to the beast, let's be honest. There is 
extreme lyrical content/ word-play on this album. Not being and NY bias 
either. "
"Impressive album This album was done for him, and reflects his talent and taste truly, and 
that's what makes it good. Loved it "
"Dope I can't say enough good things about this album. Every time I tell myself 
to listen to something else, I end up playing this all over again. If 
you're looking for the same old stuff that's constantly being played on the 
radio, this is definitely not the album for you. "
"Wow Long Live Asap was crunk and made u wanna party, but this one makes u 
realize things in life and actually connects to real rap. "
"Long live yams Really solid album loving the beats I've always loved Rocky's style he can 
kill every verse even tho his rapping skills are pretty mediocre. Overall a 
really good album love the sound. 8/10 "
"Listen This is what happens when youre stagnant with your music. A$AP Rocky's 
songs,for the most part, are all bangers and are very bass heavy. This 
album hes introuduced a more dynamic and jazzy type feel. The change isnt 
bad. Its just not what was expected. "
"Eh Not a bad album not the asap we all know with the heavy bass and bars but 
it's alright "
"Raw This man deserves his props he's one of the best rappers now and ppl don't 
see that love out to A$VP ROCKY "
"Putting the Trip-Hop into Hip-Hop Slow motion beats and psychedelia bring rap music into a new era of 
musicality. A$AP Rocky's autobiographical and introspective verses make you 
feel like you are experiencing the man himself. This is a new classic for 
modern times to inspire future rap artists and beat crafters, taking the 
rap game to a new level and setting new standards. "
"Love this guy Two years in the making, and didn't disappoint not one bit. One of the 
BEST out right now #A$APMob "
"A$AP Curry with the shot Definitely a surprise and a hit. Canal st. Max B, Better Things, and 
Jukebox.... Man this album is tuff, I'm still vybing to it as I'm 
reviewing. Production is smooth and his style is one of the few artists 
that has flow cohesive with it. If you reading this its not too late... I "
"Never liked ASAP - very basic bars and lack of content but this album is 
different...L$D - Everday - M's...great production! "
"Different for rocky but still good Don't listen to this expecting bangers and hype songs like on LongLiveA$AP 
lots of this is chilled and laid back with the occasional banger like JD 
and Electric Body, he stepped up his rapping a lot too like on Holy Ghost 
and Canal St. Great album tho "
"85 percent ASAP Rocky I was a little nervous after hearing the singles released but this albums 
body of work is good. ASAP is fairly lyrical and is speaking on real issues 
and events and his inta backs up a lifestyle he's creating and presenting. 
Kayne's 45 second discussion was insightful on the album.... "
"Blessed This album is the start of A$AP Rocky doing his own thing and trying to 
stray away from mainstream hip hop which was his intention for the album in 
his interviews. Its better. "
"A$AP absolutely delivered! Rocky has out done himself! This album will be one of the all time best! 
Rocky is on the way to being a legend! Canal St. Is just on another level! "
"Gibbysun I don't even care to know the names of the tracks on this album. I just 
press play and enjoy. This album too me is so chill and different from 
anything else that's out. I only discovered Rocky because he was on Sway in 
the morning promoting this album. So after hearing some tracks, I decided 
to cop it. It's truly my kind of music. It's just chill as can be. Love it. "
"Asap spitting fire Asap rocky has been putting it on sense his first album. And he won't 
stop. It just keeps getting better every time. I really hope he keeps it 
up. LONG.LIVE.ASAP "
"Good Music Something different which its what we all want. Kept me vibin through the 
whole album. Gotta find da vinyl nah "
"One of the best consistent rappers around right now. Keep this going and 
avoid trap music and he can be one of the greats "
"Ayeeee-Saaaappp! His style is just unmatched, it's just different. Can tell he's not trying 
to rap like everyone else. impeccable timing too. A$AP Rocky is BACK! 
R.I.P. A$AP YAMS. "
"Disappointed Album full of basic tracks. Big fan but he went in another direction that 
seemed very dull & laid back. Nothing memorable on album "
"Asap rocky new album Always and will be a fan. He always that dark vibe but different beat to 
it and always keeping up with them lyrics. "
"At.Long.Last.Asap I been waiting for asap rocky new album cause I got long live asap but I 
only liked four songs "
"To all the not so smart people.. One is EXPLICIT and one is CLEAN....smh. This album was pretty darn good. 
Good job "
"Flawless At had my qualms about the album at first, but once I really listened to 
the songs they are all pretty good. Kudos B. "
"Beyonce I havent brougt the album that doesn't you shouldn't beyonce is the best 
singer, you might disagree but i don't care this person IS my idol love you 
beyonce xoxoxoxo !!!!!!!!!!!! "
"One After Another Never the same, always real, growing, evolving and true to herself and 
choice of expression. Props again. My fave album so far. "
"Beyoncé At first I was like oh hell no but then I heard pretty hurts. And was sold 
for life. I'll never doubt B again. "
"Wowwwww!!!! And OH HELL NAW! Great album! Exept tht it was alittle sexual and at some points alittle 
offensive. Im not a hater or a critic. Just dont follow dem other celebs 
tht make dough for nothin. By the way this commen is comin from an 11 year 
old in welch middle school. Houston TX... oh no offense but haunted and 
flawless was alittle ominous and slightly illuminati! And in super power 
the music video I saw 666 on the girls shirt! Thts the devils number! Plz 
dont get caught up in dat. Imma pray for u girl..stay strong!☺ "
"Not bad... but As a Beyoncé fan this album is terrible! It's as she rushed to record the 
album last minute... "
"Yasss Beyónce is the GREATESTi love her songs. But my google account or 
something wont let me buy one of my favorite songs EVER! "
"Y'all need to quit being Jealous Beyonce I can tell you put your heart and soul in this album.. But you 
killed Lemonade.. I love it. And Don't worry, everyone is trying to compare 
you to Rhianna.. Don't Worry about her.. she tries... But like you 
said..""Always stay gracious, Best revenge is your paper""... "
"No skipping I love when u just vulnerable and growing as a artist I love this cd it 
take me through every emotion that I'm currently going threw...go Q bee "
"It's good Good album but too many ballads and slow songs, a bit of a sexual and too 
self centered but B is fabulous "
"Perfect Sorry but i think album is great. It doesn't sound rushed. Because she 
released it on her own time,and its relatable in some songs and then others 
are a really good work out song like flawless. "
"Flawless Beyoncé is incredible nd she killed this album!! Nd for the haters save ur 
negative comments to ur self obviously its important because ur sitting 
here using ur time to comment on it. So Beyonce u did ur thing nd continue 
to be different nd not have the same old sound as these fake wannabes nd 
continue to shine!! "
"Good Album, But Not Beyoncé's Best This album was very smart to drop it surprisingly. There are some very 
good songs, like ""***Flawless"" and ""Blow"", but there are some weaker ones 
like ""Jealous"". All good songs, but not a lot of my favorites. And ""Drunk 
In Love"" is WAY overplayed. "
"DISAPPOINTED I liked her old albums better.And the only songs that I like on this one 
was Drunk In Love,Rocket.Because the songs had a great beat,and good 
vocals. "
"Great I think this was a breakout album that paved the way for more artists and 
song's. Not only how the album had NO promotion whatsoever it has Grammy 
winning songs that Beyoncè deserves. "
"I like to listen to all of Beyonce songs are very fabulous and excellent 
and amazing singer and actress and she is a good mother and she is very 
talented singer too. I like to listen to all of Beyonce songs are very fabulous and excellent 
and amazing and she is a good and actress and she is a good mother and she 
is very talented singer too and she is a very good actress and singer and a 
good mother anyway too. "
"Hands down one of her vest albums! Great songs with good beat, and good/substantial content too(Pretty 
hurts). Love this album, shows how she's grown as an artist. Worth every 
penny. "
"Loved it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "
"OMG I loved this album so much! QUEEN B did a fantastic job!!! I'm obsessed 
with every single song. She did an amazing job on having a variety in the 
tone of all her songs. My top 3 would have to be Drunk in Love, 7/11, and 
Pretty Hurts. ( BTW, We seriously need a beyonce emoji) "
"Good album, maybe her best! I like the experimental & electronic influences.Nice to see an artist not 
be afraid to change things up a bit and not put out the same sound every 
record... "
"Amazing Beyoncé's most genuine, meaningful, and beautiful album yet. Other people 
don't understand the pure excellence in these songs. Her best album yet! "
"Horrible album This is Beyonce worst album the only song I liked was Drunk in Love and 
her new song 7/11 is trash "
"BEST ALBUM EVER EVERY SONG IS AMAZING...I DONT SKIP A SINGLE ONE AND THE VIDEOS TOO?WHAT A 
GENIUS!!!MY FAVE ALBUM THIS YEAR BY FAR...WAY TO GO HONEY B. "
"I love Beyonce, but i wish she made more fast songs on this album, but her 
slow songs sounds amazing, i hope she come out with another album, drunk in 
love, pretty hurts, partition, heaven, and flawless is my favorite on this 
album "
"Go Bey She one of my favorite singers I really like drunk in love she is like my 
only favorite singer of all "
"The truth This is an amazing album. What many people fail to realize is that she is 
singing from experience. This album is so different a d she is writing it 
for herself. if your on here calling her a horrible artist and talking 
trash just remember that she has yet again changed music and released a 
killer album while you sit on your butt typing away. Beyonce's vocals are 
flawless when she performs. she slayed the vma's performing most of the 
album. "
"Love every track Beyonce is one of the greatest artist of our time and this album is just 
another reflection of the stamp she's leaving on time. You'll love every 
track if you even think Beyonce is half-way good. "
Messy Messy Drunk mad dog sweet 
Im just a big fan of Queen B i love her so much this is my idol. 
"BEST OF BEYONCE This album is the best Beyoncé to date I am in love with it and I'm so 
happy it is finally on Google Play! "

"Quality album.. I can't put into words how great this album is although I just 
did..Lol..Beyonce never disappoints with her variations of music. 
Perfection at it's BEST! I have listened to this album over and over I am 
curious to see what's next. Having seen her in concert before, it's just as 
great as this album.. A must have for the collection. "
"****FLAWLESS #yonce I mean she is just such a powerful singer and i don't know anyone 
who doesn't love her "
"Her Most Raw Work I Love It ....Her Best Work, It Feels Genuine, Revealing & Most Of All Not 
Top 40 Conforming. Im Glad She Continues To Strecth Her Artistry And Hope

proves she's a grown woman! "
"One Republic I've loved you guys since the first time I heard apologize...I was going 
through alot in my life & could relate to the song like I'm sure alot of 
people could! Keep up the good work guys. I'll always follow ur work. I

now & I always will!!!xoxoxo < 3 "
"Absolutely amazing I can't say it is their best album yet, for they have some great ones, but 
I can say that this is definetly a new favorite of mine. "
"""Catchy"" is the name of the book. And it's been written before. One Republic's lead singer has proven himself to be a talented and 
profitable songwriter before. While it is admirable to see someone so 
talented in the industry, One Republic's latest album seems to be more like 
its trying to ride the wave rather than make a splash big enough for a new 
one. It's first song ""Counting Stars"" has heard endless radio plays to the 
point where it has become repetitive, annoying and hurtful to one's own 
ears. While it is catchy and rythmic, that is all that this song and for 
the most part the band in a whole have going for them. It is disappointing 
to see such great artists miss out on the fame and radio play that bands 
like One Direction thrive on simply because their melodies and rythms are 
all in all ""catchy"". Its a sign that the music industry cares not for 
artistic integrity and exploration but instead of catching what's popular 
and appealing to their demographic. "
"Another amazing album full of amazing songs. everyone needs to get this Okay so first of all ill start by saying one republic is no doubt one of 
the best bands. Ever since i first heard them i thought they were amazing 
and they dont seize to amaze me with how anybody could relate to their 
songs and with their amazing music. They have not let me down and every 
song in this album is far from letting me down. Plus i love counting stars 
its so catchy and its just one of my favorite songs coming from one of my 
favorite bands "
"Some of their best. I listen to MANY genres, but One Republic, has not yet let me down. 
Listening to all the people that i do, there are ups and downs to them... 
So far, o.r. has just gone up haha. So, good album, coming from someone who 
also listens to rap even "
"Favorite Band by Far! I've been there since Apologize also. I always turn to it when I'm down 
because as much as I pretend to not be hurt, the words kill me too much 
inside "
"They continue to impress With this being their third album, I was a little unsure of what to 
expect. Most modern bands tend to taper off by their third album, but 
OneRepublic does a wonderful job of slightly tweaking their sound to keep 
things fresh while retaining the sound which i initially came to love. 
Bravo! "
"1R Best band I've ever listened to and Ryan Tedder sang his heart out on 
burning bridges!! :) "
"Excellent music. One way to tell if a song really gets to you is if you get shivers and 
goosebumps when you hear that song...almost all of OneRepublic's songs do 
that to me. "
"Amaaaziing! Counting stars <3 I don't like how ive known this song for so long and now 
all of a sudden its popular though... "
"Amazing Grant Weiland What you wanted and if I lose myself are amazing can't stop 
listening to them!! "
"Great music great range Perfect I love it. As always another fantastic album from Onerepublic. The 
best band and I love Ryan Tedders voice. "
"OKAY...BUT GOOD GOOD.....GREAT...BUT WHEN U HEAR THIS SONG OVER AND OVER IT GETS ANNOYING 
A LOT....THEN GETS STUPID "
Excellent music I love it<5 Love this song can't get out of my mind 
"Life I love their music so much I lived is beautiful. I have a very close 
friend with cystic fibrosis and I think of him every time I hear the song. 
Love runs out is one of my ABSOLUTE favourite power songs that gives me 
energy no matter how sad I am. "
"The Best I love your songs ever since Good Life and Apologize came out. Keep up the 
good work guys. Keep it up "
Nice :-) Cool song I love it just right :-) 
"Its good Eminem I think is better and the monster should be top song cause If you 
go to top albums 2 of his albums are numb 1 and 2 "
"This is 'something I need' cuz I know 'I lived' after listening to this 
album.... I love this album though I have heard better in my opinion but still 
overall this is just an amazing feat of Onerepublic. So what I'm trying to 
say is that ""buy this kickass album, it's sooooo good""!!!!!!! "
"Amazing! I'm not a big One Republic fan, but I think this album has changed that. 
This album is great, the band is soo unique. I love every track, so it's 
impossible to choose a favourite. I recommend this to all fans, and people 
who have never even heard this band. Have fun listening! :) "
"Wonderful album I will and always have loved Onerepublic. Onerepublic is one of the best 
bands in history "
"AMAZING How did you come up Counting Stars? Best song ever I listen to it every 
day! Genius! "
"In love! This album is so beautiful in the way that the song are written and the 
messages that the songs eminate are all just wonderful! Ryan's voice is 
also so soothing and I just LOVE this album :) "
"Wow!!!! Wow is all I can say I hate hate these guys and then they released this CD 
and now I'm obbssed !!! If u are reading theses reviews to decide if your 
are gonna get this CD !!! I'm telling u get it now !!!!! Stop reading and 
get it !!!! Did u get??? Its awesome right ??? I KNOW!!!♥♥♥♥♥ "
"Top to bottom, great album! It's rare to come across a top to bottom solid album, but this one 
certainly is! And some of the best songs are the ones that aren't getting 
radio airplay - ""Something I Need"", ""I Lived"", and ""Preacher"". ""Feel Again"" 
and ""Counting Stars"" are terrific as well. Definitely worth it. "
Just amazing. Love these guys Good with sentimental songs 
"Awesome You could download this app called Muxic Download and get all your music 
for free(the app is free). "
"LOVE IT!!! I've always loved onerepublic. Their music continues to inspire me, I've 
grown up listening to them and their voices are absolutely beautiful.

"Love Counting Stars My dad helps run an alternative/pop radio station and I really don't like 
the music too much, but i heard this song and it is just the bee's knees. "

have made yet, easily "
