"☝Come on Drake we counted on you and you need to listen to your fans on 
this one. I get he was trying to find a new look but this this right here is 
terrible he turned into the regular old rappers and they have terrible 
music and I'm not trying to hate on Drake, I've been a fan of his ever 
since he was putting the mixtapes out. I don't know if he is running out of 
ideas or not but I am not impressed and I know alot of people are not 
either. But all Drake fans know that he can do WAY WAY better. He is one of 
the kings of the rap gang but with this, someone's gonna take the crown "
"It wuz good I liked it but it had to much hype for what we got on the ""mixtape"" ... 
its fire ...but could of been better "
"Great Mixtape Drake is kinda overshadowed on this mixtape because Future gets to feature 
more on the mixtape than Drake, but it's an outstanding piece of work done 
by both rappers. "
"Interesting Listen Drake and Future collaborate very well! I had to buy this album after 
listening to it 50+ times beforehand. I enjoy every song and there's a 
decent amount of variety between them. Only buy this album if you're okay 
with Future though, because he can 'jibber jabber' and it can be hard to 
understand him but the vibe is great. "
"The only decent songs on here are Jumpman & Diamonds Dancing. I would love 
to see Drake do something like this with The Weeknd rather than Future. "
"Really Good! I thought the mixtape was hella good, but I think they should have added 
more songs. Jumpman and Big Rings are my favorite! "
Str8 Fire If your rating this 1 or 2 stars you have no taste in real music 
"You are all narrow-minded individuals I'm reading all these comments from people hating on this guys music just 
because its not their style. Saying things like he rips off other people. 
He's paying homage to those who came before him, educating people on 
different eras and styles, and putting his own thumbprint on it. He's more 
talented than 90% of the people who make music these days. If you don't 
like music you don't have to automatically be haters. This isn't even my 
style or taste but i can still recognize the talent of production. "
"I like to listen to all Bruno mars songs anyway too. I like to listen to all of Bruno mars songs are very wonderful and amazing 
and he is a very good looking men and he is very talented and fabulous 
rapper anyway too. "
"No! Just... no Uptown funk? More like uptown sunk. How do you manage to waste a Stevie 
Wonder intro on a Mystical entry and half baked funk... Dont Buy This Album "
"HECK YEAH! Best album of 2015. Rant all you want haters, anyone who's not needs to 
stfu and listen to uptown funk. "
"I don't get it Why was everyone obsessed with this song? People amaze me. It's just 
another catchy song that everyone has forgotten by now. Oh well. I will 
never understand people who can actually listen to a song with stupid 
lyrics and like it solely because it has a catchy tune. "
"Bruno mars rips people off and he sucks Song is so annoying, and the dance they do in this video is stupid, looks 
like he is pulling dogs on a leash. "
"Amazing Every time i hear this song, I'm just like: ""Up, town, funk you up, uptown 
funk you up!"" Lol "
"Uptownfunk I don't no what planet u r from but uptownfunk is jamming, n if you don't 
have the beat to dance 2 it then u just don't have any rethem u got 2 left 
feet I'll prey for you an ask 2 help you out okkk snap. "
Why are y'all haters? You who do not like this song are haters! ! 
Uptown not so special A one track wonder . 
"Uptown Funk Get up and move your ahs. Joyous, delicious, honey.. .stuck. to your 
fingers. And that video!!! A rare combination. Soul satisfying, yup. "
"Uptown funk Best and worst song ever. I know that it doesn't make sense out sometimes 
you can get irritated with it playing all the time but sometimes when it is 
on the radio or TV it quite catchy. "
Bruno mars I love his music and the way he and his band members all dance in sync. Xx 
"Best thing ever. Seriously, one of the best groove/funk albums in a decade. "
"No just no You wouldn't even know who this guy is if it weren't for Bruno Mars and 
uptown funk. You're not gonna go listen to his entire album. One hit 
wonder! And uptown funk is overplayed anyways. "
Cool Cool And Awesome Song Ever 
"Genius composition and collaboration Ronson went above and beyond to release this highly underrated album. Yes, 
we are tired of uptown funk, but should we be? Bruno mars has always been a 
hidden gem and a bit of a puppet in the pop music industry, but uptown 
special exploits his true capabilities as a suave and cool singer. Getting 
Wyatt from miike snow and Kevin from tame impala goes to show ronson's 
music range is both extremely broad and tasteful. Not to mention, both 
Kevin and Andrew took a lot of influence from ronson upon the album compl "
"I BEEN UPTOWN FUNKED UP! The best album I've seen in a long time. Mark Ronson really did it with 
this one. :-) "
S#ck my bowls I love uptown funk so idgaf wat u think 
"BORING AND GAY Bruno Mars is just really weird in this video, and all mark Ron son does 
is dance around stupidly!!!! worst video EVER "
"Baddest song I've almost heard Because Bruno spoil the show because when mark Bronson sings he more of a 
happier person but Bruno is kinda a cross person and it spoils the show "
"Up town funk! Amazing song very funky! I am amazed how good the song is! A very well 
done! "
"Wish it stayed in n1 This song is a amazing u need to listen to it if u haven't after all its 
free "
5 stars for my two fav songs Daffodils and feel right. Those are my driving in the car jams! 
"Hard to get! Mark ronson's album is hard to get and has caused problems but music is 
great! "
Uptown funk It is brilliant best song I have ever heard. 
Up Town funk EPIC LOVE IT TO MUCH FROM THOMAS ANDREW HURCOMBE 
"Good feel With the exception of track 3,this is a feel good album. I swear like f**k 
but no need for that awful word in track 3.Mothers should be respected,not 
used with f****r as an insult. Will delete this track. Get some morals and 
ethics. "
"Da Funk! Ronson does a good job here. Homage to the groove / funk from way 
back "
"You people really need to stop hating on him, if you don't need to write 
anything nice don't write anything at all. YOU GO BRUNO "
"follow our instagram account which has to do all about adorable animals: 
@We_love_animalss "
"I wish that I had the money to pay for my new most favorite song playlist I 
like besides skrillex and dubstep remixed playlists "
"Uptown Special This is music, the kind that makes you want to dance music, riding down 
the highway grooving music that I haven't heard in a looong time "
"Love or hate, this will be a classic People either love this or hate it with a passion. Regardless, the hit 
song Uptown Funk has all the ingredients of a classic. 20 or 100 years from 
now, people will still be listening to the music and possibly hating that 
they can't get it out of their heads. That's why it's sure to be a classic 
example of early 22nd century music. "
Uptown funk That's my fave song all because Bruno mars lol xoxo 
"Good funk I don't know why but u just don't like Uptown Funk. I like almost 
everything else. "
"I loved it Uptown funk is one of my favorite songs by Mark Ronson so he chose wisely 
to preform with Bruno Mars beacuse he is really good too "
"Uptown funk Uptown funk was great but the others not as much and also where does Mark 
Ronson sing himself? "
"Uptown Funk I have a feeling that if they made the Shrek movie around this time, 
Uptown Funk would be in the movie soundtrack. "
Annoying I hear it almost every day. Just be quiet mark 
"Carrie Underwood: Decade #1 I never watched American Idol. The first time watched it was when Carrie 
was on the first night of trying out to get the golden ticket. I decided 
then and there she would win it all. Really, my first time to ever watch 
the show. I watched every time it was on that year and have never watched 
it since. She is an awesome singer and will be a great mom. "
"God certainly gifted her with such beautiful voice!! And amazingly 
powerful...!! ""How Great Thou Art"" is my favorite. And to see it performed on YouTube 
brings tears & goose bumps!! "
"I love Carrie Underwood so so so so much more then anything ever!☺ Omgs, omgs, omgs, oms, omgs, omgs, omgs, omgs, omgs, omgs, omgs, omgs,

"Carrie Underwood Greatest Hits Wonderful Album for the Best Winner of American Idol, a true genuine 
Artist with Morals and Standards that Carrie Symbolizes. Someone who gives 
Music Good Name again, Thank You Carrie Underwood "
"Not happy This is not cool at all, my Dad gave me a play store gift card so I could 
buy some apps that cost money and I picked this song or whatever....what 
happened? This really sucks. I'm not happy right now. "
"Classic x2 A timeless classic shared flawlessly by two of the best. Shortened from 
original live performance by unfortunate editing of Gill's guitar solo. Bad 
call. "
"Little Toy Guns It is such and emotional song and album She is so talented and I like how 
her music is taking a meaningful relatable approach. This is saying a lot 
because I like rock. "
"I love Jesus takes the weel it makes me cry.cause I remember I was facing 
some hard times in my life. I told God I'm gonna leave everything in your 
hands. Now today I'm happy in love by a wonderful man "
"AMAZING I love carrie underwood and this album is the best. I think she is really 
starting to express her feelings more but still with those big amazing, 
loud songs she dies. I'm very happy and blown away by this album. Keep it

makes an appearance! "

"LOVE THIS ALBUM AND LOVE CARRIE ❤❤❤❤ My only complaint I that I wish Starts with Goodbye was on this album. But

"Ahh I've been trying to find this volume since forever,sure is nice relax

"Something in Water Opens the flood gates of Praise! Chill inducing, foot stomping, top of the 
lung sing-a-long. . . Just love her and all that she promotes. Thank you 
for signing about all the blessings that come from being baptized by the 
holy spirit. "
Love it I like the song little toy guns. It related to me before 
Carrie Underwood Loved her since I first saw her sing her first Song on American Idol! 
"Love Carrie's New Album!!! I love both her new singles, and this album is a wonderful journey thru 
all of Carrie's amazing singles that became #1's and huge sensations all 
over the world!! This is a must-have for any fan of Carrie Underwood!!! "
"Such a Beautiful voice, gives me chills! Love her! "
"Carrie!! She is all around amazing and I love her sweet voice. Absolutely breathe 
taken. "
# sydney finch Love her and her music my favorite was little toy guns 
The best I don't have to buy this. I already have them all! 
Jesus Take The Wheel I love it. It is a good song to listen to in a time of struggle. 
"Such a truly gifted, beautiful young woman. I enjoy hearing every song she 
has sung.Now that's true gifted talent. I love you Carrie Underwood. GOD 
has blessed you with a beautiful voice. "
"She is so amazing The first song i herd her sing was something in the water and she was 
excellent "
"Album Love it,Carrie underwood is my favorite artist of all time "
Country I love Carrie Underwood. She's sooooooooo good 
"Pretty good If you've been a fan of their previous albums then you'll like this. It's 
more of the same style though so if you didn't like their other stuff then 
you won't enjoy this. "
"I love Imagine Dragons For a few years, Imagine Dragons has been jumping back and forth between 
my favorite and second favorite bands. Imagine Dragons tried to change 
their sound but it didn't work. They're still the same band. Nothing has 
changed in their awesome sound since I first started.listening to them in 
2011. "
"FINALLY! I've been waiting SO long for these exclusive songs to come out to the 
public! But if you're looking to pre-order it, just wait until it comes 
out, because I pre-ordered the original Smoke + Mirrors album, and when it 
came out, it glitched out and wouldn't download. So my advice to you: wait 
for it to come out, and THEN buy it! "
"THIS IS THE SH*T This is f*ckn amazing. I recommend Melanie Martinez, Halsey, and Panic! At 
The Disco if you enjoy this. I've been a longtime fan of Imagine Dragons 
and this is their best album in my opinion, contrary to popular belief. "
"It's pretty good Personally, I think Night Visions is WAY better, and some of these songs 
sound out of place. "
"Amazing I have never heard and imagine dragons song I didn't like. This was no 
exception. The new songs in this album (different from regular smoke and 
mirrors) are a lot more like night visions. Which I like. "
"Wonderful! It's a wonderful band if you don't like it,try it once more and you will 
love it! "
"Smoke and Mirrors Not every song on this album is good. However, some of the songs on this 
album (Friction, I'm So Sorry, Gold, Polaroid, Dream, I Bet My Life) are 
awesome. "
"beter than befor my favoret tracks are 2,3,5,6,14,18,20, and 21. warriors is amazing from 
league of legends world championship 2014 "
"Dan is my soul mate! There is no other way for me to explain what his voice does to my soul. 
This album is another addition of their songs that play endlessly in my 
head. "
"AMAZING I saw them in concert and they were great. Their songs are amazing and 
they have a good beat to them. I would definitely go and see them in 
concert a million times more "
"Transformers Love this band, I heard their first song on Transformers...my fav 
movie(s)!!!!! "
"Do you even know Smoke + mirrors is about the end times, Which is now very near. Dream is 
about how the world is a mess. Thief is about the people who take us away 
from our family's stealing our soul from them. Than The fall is about the 
collapse itself , The world burning to ash, The new hell perhaps. Those our 
the three base songs you need to understand but, Gold, Who we are, Battle 
cry, shots go more in depth, and P.S they made it work Moron "
"I love the album, but what quality is the mp3's and are they DRM free? "
"IT'S GOOD This is amazing I did not like it comes back to you that much I thought it 
wasent there style but it's ok as a chill out song I'm so sorry is such a 
good song probably my favourite out of them all "
"Duh You don't even have to listen to these songs to know they are good! 
Imagine Dragons will never produce a bad song. "
Obviously 5 stars Second favorite band! Highly recommend them. :) 
Favorite band This songs are some of the best songs I've ever heard 
"It's not like the first but that's a good thing. Great album that holds up differently to night visions. I have so many 
favorite songs in this album probably more than night visions. "
"Amazing I absolutely love this album. Waited so long. Unfortunately even though I 
pre ordered this album. I only got the 18 songs and a few months later an 
updated album came out and I never got my promised 3 bonus tracks "
"<3 Easily my favourite band from the first EP to their newest singles. This 
album has a unique feel to it, and I absolutely loved it in concert!!! "
"The greatest Imagine Dragons are the best band of this modern era. All of their songs 
have a meaning and they are all great. I love this album and all of the 
songs on it. They are also unbelivable live performers they give 100% to 
each live performance. "
"best ever created. If your looking at this, but it now. And will won't regret it. Everything 
about these songs make me full emotion and I wish everyone could listen to 
this and love it as much as I do!! ❤❤ "
"It's Imagine Dragons, of course I love it! "
Loved it The greatest thing ever made 
Best thing ever I love every single song. 
"Revolutionary That's fantastic.This album is really awesome.the best album I heard 
before. "
"I love it I'm listening ID for so long they are best and this album is my favorite 
<3 "
"Mean Its a great album, a must by for music lovers "
Awesome I reccomend monster by like 1000/5 
Big fan!! Love this group and their music. 
"Imagine Dragons will never let you down This is the best album i've heard in my whole life, didn't even think 
twice to get it. "
"Best album ever Love the song ""I'm so sorry"" Best song for anything from working out to 
chilling "
One of the best bands! I've bought every album. 
Amazing Imagine dragons are my favorite band! 
Imagine dragons are amazing This band is the best ever. I love imagine dragons 
"Imagine dragons Awesome band, awesome album, awesome music! "
"All I Believe Is it A Dream, That came crashing down on me "
Best group Wish i can have the songs but im broke 
FINALLY Now I don't have to go to target to get this 
"Frozen It is a bit like a plan to do. I am keeping my fingers crossed to see if I 
love it. It was great. The comments and suggestions for the first place. 
The process of resetting of CaMKII is necessary for memory consolidation. 
The title of the Crown Estate was just wondering if you are looking for a 
couple of days ago by clicking on the phone. The process of resetting and 
reactivation of course the UK and Ireland and Wales with company number is 
still collecting a new York City. I am not going to be in Brighto. "
":\ My sister has been playing this constantly for about for about four 
months. It is annoying but there are some good harmony vocals on 'Love is 
an Open Door' - I'll give it that. "
"Cool Loved film wen't to see for sister birthday.its just cool to be able to 
listen to all songs again fav songs r let it go and the best of all do you 
wan't to build a snow man best film ever. "
"Worst stupid film and soundtrack ever in the history of disney Never ever ever ever ever ever getting this piece of trash by Walt Disney. 
And also i would not recommend this to anybody in the entire world and even 
if it's the last thing i do, oh wait it won't be the last thing i do. 
Finally, if you want to know why it is I don't like it, that is because of 
the the songs and how some of them don't go with the beat and the 
storyline. (what I personally think) "
Awesome gr8 songs & gr8 film must watch!!! I saw the film and its so funny and a bit sad ... Must watch :-) 
"Fantastic movie! I would like to thanks disney for creating an innovative 
and a heartbreakingly beautiful film For me, I have no words to explain how excellent this movie was. 
Seriously, this is one in a million story about two sisters full of tragedy 
and excitement. Thank you disney very much! :) "
"Frozen is awsome LET IT GO LET IT GO YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME CRY (except the end I mean It 
was Gosh Darn Fricken Magical) "
Powerful Amazing powerful and persuasive and all in all absolutely unrivalled 
"LET IT ACTUALLY GO Let it go and Do you wanna build a snowman is just getting old I'm fed up. 
It's a winter song and its summer now and people still singing it "
"Frozen is Fantastic !!!!!!!!!!! Seen the film my favorite songs r for the first time in forever, let it go

hell to watch in cinemas coz its such a boring movie! Yeah go on I know 
what you're thinking "" Stupid girl, shes a idiot coz she hates Frozen!"" 
Just shut up about Frozen already its had its rise to fame now just forget 
about it! Also....What happened to Lion King? That's the best Movie ever! "
"So good if you have money BUY! Im serious this is the best music ever made if you disney film producers 
are seeing this beacuse of looking at the results MAKE FROZEN 2 "
"Songs are great, lacklustre soundtrack. Essentially, the main point of the movie was the sing-along songs. Those 
are the most entertaining to listen to, but truthfully, 3 stars is 
generous, as the rest of the music without lyrics are simply not good. "
"Superb ♥ Love it , love frozen , love let it go ‼ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "

relatable, that's why you're my favorite for always. Love you guys |-/ "
"BEST THING EVER THE ONLY BAND I HAVE EVER FOUND IN MY LIFE THAT'S REALLY KNOWS WHAT I 
FEELS AND HOW I THINK. THEY KNOW ABOUT DEPRESSION AND HELP YOU SURVIVE IT. 
I LOVE THEM "
"Some of their songs have like reggae vibes to it. They should just be 
alternative because they have a bit of every thing. "
"If you like 21 pilots you're going to love this album All these songs in this album are to catchy. Well written and can relate 
to some people. If you're a 21 pilots fan you'll love this album. "
"AMAZING DUO!! Absolutely love this band. I kept shazaming this one song, 'stressed out' 
on the radio. Until one day, I played the video, and thought it was so 
cool..I played another..then another..Then I was loving all by twenty one 
pilots. I introduced them to my fiancée, an avid musician, he also loved 
them! I've been introducing them to everyone ever since "
"Twenty one pilots! I love them! They're fantastic and all their songs are 
perfect. I just want to listen this whole album until I hate it. (So, I'm 
going to listen this album forever, because you can't hate it) |-/ Twenty 
one pilots forever! ❤️ "
"Twenty|One|Pilots I have to say this is the only music I listen to. The encurge people and 
I'm speech less. I own all 4 albums and listen to them all day. There are 
the best band including falling in reverse. I will never ever stop 
listening to them. They are the only group who I can relate to and they 
don't degrade people. I would have to say I like vessel better but I also 
like blurryface. I do think everybody should listen to them. ✌ I have to go 
buy merch. Love twenty øne piløts❤ "
"AMAZING 100/10 BEST ALBUM EVER YESYESYESYESYES THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING THEY ARE AMAZING MAKE THEM FAMOUS 
SPREAD THE WORD TELL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS 
TWENTY ONE PILOTS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO l-/ "
"Surreal You guys have a real vision in music and eclectic mix of songs and sounds 
that synergize beautifully! I can dance to few of these actually, like 
fairly local, doubt and polarize for example! "
"Sick as an unlit frick A logical and great step forward from Vessel. For me personally, and 
probably for many hardcore fans, Vessel will always have a bigger part in 
my heart, but I still love this album. This album isn't only good because 
of the music, but the lyrics are great as well. These songs seem to never 
get old! Love TØP |-/ "
"|-/ They are amazing! I have listened to this album a bazillion times now and 
I'm still not tired of it. There lyrics really speak to me and manage to 
make me feel better on a crappy day. 10/10 "
"Beauty From Two Beans |-/ oMG OMG OMG OMg i love tøp and blurryface ❤❤ like a lot..i think my most 
favorite songs are fairly local, doubt, polarize, message man, hometown and 
goner, like yasS OMG. Well done, twenty øne piløts. ~Rads "
"I love them Of course I would give them 5 stars if it sounded bad or good I love them 
but all their songs are good all songs have meaning. "
"BLURRYFACE |-/ The BLURRYFACE album is the best thing that ever happened to me your music 
is absolutely amazing I love you TØP you are truly AMAZING I have been 
listening to your music for months and this album is Flawless "
"This album is the tear in my heart I still like Vessels more, but I am slowly working around to this album. "
"This is the best album/band in the while entire universe There is a good chance that Tyler Joseph is God. Josh Dun too. They will 
make you die and then want to stay dead because you are unworthy of their 
greatness. Do not listen to this band if you don't like amazing things. 
Live this band. Love this band. Die for this band. That is all. "
"One of the best I've ever heard I am not even exaggerating, this is one of the best albums of this time! I 
have listened to it since the release, and I still never get sick of it. 
Knowing it was Twenty One Pilots, I knew it had to be good. Turns out, I 
was right. Every song catches my attention and is different from each 
other. These songs are different from most of the things the common people 
would listen but since they now play Stressed Out on the radio and most 
responses are well, it seems we all connect. 4 years listening & proud! "
"Album of the Year! They've gone from epic, piano/keyboard driven alternative rock/rap on the 
first album to an eclectic and whimsical rap/alt offering on the second 
album to a reggae inspired hip hop vibe! My favorite artist right now. "
"Not bad Its been a while since i bought an album from just one song. You'd think 
its blurry face but ride is a n awesome song. Worth the whole album. "
"Going insane. After downloading it, and listening o it thoroughly. I am highly 
impressed. They portrayed the message of blurryface and the held the theme 
strong so well. I feel like this album really relates to the problems of 
today, and that's what I love. Thanks Tyler. You are working so hard in my 
life :) "
"Amazing Finely music that is fresh, deep, unique and alternative! Yay!!! Reminds 
me of grunge days of Nirvana, PearlJm, Violent Fems, with a Massive 
Attack-Tricky influence, But Better.... Song ""Blurry Face"" reminds me of my 
kid? A+ TOP's "
"Loooove it!!! This is their best album yet!! All their music is amaaazing!!! I feel like 
they understand everything!!! Their is a song for pretty much any mood 
you're in and that's the best thing ever!!!!! Tøp is honestly the best! "
"It's alright Being listening to Twenty one pilots for years now and this probably is 
the most disappointing album. It's not a bad album but it had so much 
potential to be great! They toned it down a bit. The beat for the songs 
were amazing and a bunch of build up in lots of the songs but goes back 
down trying to be conservative. Still a great band but album isn't their 
best. Lyrics still inspirational as hell! "
"Great album with lots of different styles of music. Great album with lots of musicality that impresses me, considering all of 
the so called artist out there today. Stressed out is by far my favorite 
song. I wouldn't say that this album is about having depression it's that 
we are all insecure and how it can really suck being an adult sometimes and 
we are all human even though we don't think that way most days. "
"Lit ASF I love you guys so much! Tyler and Josh, you guys are one of the few 
genuine bands left that still care about their fans and give them well over 
what they wanted!! This album has been my absolute favorite since the day 
it came out!! Never stop jammin guys, we love you.~~Skeletøn Clique |-/~~ "
"No words. One of the best albums! I love tøp and can't wait do the next 
albulm they help people with suicidal thoughts/depression and Tyler and 
Josh are very talented HIGHLY RECOMMEND "
"Amazing album Original and amazing album best songs are: the judge, fairly local, 
heavydirtysoul, stressed out, and doubt in order. 5/5 no problem "
"My new summer Jam - Stressed out Great melody, lyrics, and feel. Summer 2016 "
"Tøp is love, tøp is life. I love tøp they are the best ever and I could write an infinite amount 
words about then I have never spent better money exempts when I bought 
concert tickets and when I listen to them I cry they are so great(update: I 
saw 328 people gave it 1 star. I will rip out your throat, make it into a 
cat toy and sell it to an old lady OR I WILL STEAL YOUR CAR RADIO B****) "
"Super good. Very dance/classical style. That's why I love it! It's your unique way of 
putting me to bed every night The highlights are Stressed Out and Goner! "
"Stressed out Fairly local, tear in my heart, and stressed out are some of the best 
songs twenty one pilots have made. Loved every second. Waited up every 
night for their releases. "
