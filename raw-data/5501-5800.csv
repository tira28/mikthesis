"All about the Bass My 7yr old son and 6yr old daughter love to hear her music it's very 
upbeat and this song should be a tribute to all little girls and women . No 
one should make them selves sick trying to be what they are not. I tell my 
children love comes from within,don't judge a book by its cover.My 2older 
sons hear this song and say mom not again but I say listen to her .Kids 
today need people who tell the truth in music so they listen,not the 
garbage music that talks about sex ,drugs and money .thank you. "
"Awful x100 Simply awful. Not worth the hype she gets by any extent. Save your money 
and your time. "
"Great music Haters are going to hate. I love that she is being positive for young 
girls and adults. Truth hurts and its a fact people don't like the truth! "
"The more I hear... The more I hear, the more I love Meghan Trainor! Her 50's inspired music 
has that fun catchy beat that you just can't help but dance to! It brings a 
smile to my face every time I hear her music! And I just love watching my 
daughter, her Girl Scout troop, and all her other friends dancing and 
singing along to these great songs! Such positive messages for everyone - 
reminding us all to love and respect ourselves no matter our physical 
features! "
"Hope this is just a preview! I look forward to more from her. This EP has a catchy updated 50s feel to 
it but its MUSIC. The stuff that you can actually swing your hips and move 
your feet to, not booty shake. The lyrics are clear with a positive message 
so sing along and enjoy your day. This is a refreshing change to the pop 
scene. "
"She's going places... My daughter, boyfriend, and I all enjoy all about that bass. She 
incorporates a trinidadian/carribean flare with doo-wop and pop. I feel 
like she encorporates fun and a bit of humor to her songs which makes it 
fun and enjoyable for her listeners as well. She has had much experience 
writing hits for other famous artists and I am glad she is getting her time 
to shine. I can't wait to hear more from her. (ps. anyone who says that 
they like all about that bass and say that her other songs thus far are 
nothing like it clearly cannot hear all the same influences that you hear 
in her debut song...) "
"Sweet Talk about sweet beats. I mean there really good. I listen to these songs 
like every single day. People who say these songs are stupid are wrong and 
judge mental. "
"Seen it before These lyrics sound like they were taken off of Twitter and the music isn't 
very unusual. Heard it already. This entire song is pretty typical. "
"Love her spunk!! Awesome lyrics & great classic beats. No matter the subject always upbeat. 
Just makes you want to tap your foot & sing along. "
"Nice but.... I like this album and I am only on the first song but I hate how you have 
to pay 3.00 to listen to a songs "
"Catchy, True, Fun!! These songs are so great! Beat is very catchy and fun to dance/sing to and 
the lyrics are so supportive and true, definite words girls and women need 
to be hearing. :) This lady is a must hear!! "
"I love it... All about that bass was amazing. I liked it and thought was super 
catchy... At my school we always have a fun day every Wednesday and we 
always have a dance off... For the dance off the school picked All about 
that bass! It was so cool. "
"Leave her alone She is saying like the other person said love me for who I am and like my 
body big. And that's ok with me "
"Love her sound She has such an original sound. What a talent. Being a singer myself I'm 
very picky. Cant wait to hear more from her. "
"Great fun music I got 4 songs of Meghan Trainor is Close Your Eyes Dear future husband 
Title and all about that bass. Thanks "
"Future Husband That song is ridiculously catchy! Though, 'All About That Bass' is a bit 
hypocritical however, its a good song. "
"Good stuff Out there and direct I like it. Tired of the stations over playing her 
""all about that bass"" "
"Breath of fresh air So different from anything else right now. It's fun, just makes me want to 
get up & dance! "
"Eh The other songs don't really add much reason to enjoy her music at this 
point. It sounds good but not captivating. "
"Meghan Trainer Brings a little of rock n roll to her songs Elivs Presley feel good music 
keep it don't change Meghan love it♥♥ "
"I love Meghan Trainor! It'd not Just her music that's beautiful, she is too. Catchy, fun, spunky, 50s-ish and just awesome!!!! "
"Awesome!!! Love her album!! The songs are great and very catchy! Love some of the 
positive messages they send through for example in All about that bass - it 
talks about how women should flaunt their beauty, and that they shouldnt 
hide it and be embarassed for their shape/size. "
"Catchy! Love this, can't wait to hear what comes next from her. The oldies style 
pop music is so catchy, you can't help but love it. "
"Because you know I'm all about that bass All about that bass is an amazing song. Not just that song, but all of 
them! She has a really pretty voice and the songs make you wanna get up and 
dance/sing to them all day long. Can't wait for the next album of Meghan's! "
"Nice If you think this whole EP sounds the same then you obviously don't listen 
to the lyrics. This is pure genius I can't wait for a full length Lp. "
Wow I'm speechless! I'm lovin' it. :) 
Love Meghan. Trainor I have this song dear future husband stuck in my head 
"Clever, funky, eclectic I've listened to all 3 songs plus all about that bass on Pandora and 
they're catchy, fun, and enjoyable to jam to. "
"I love her voice As some one who likes vocalists that bridge a musical gap, I find it 
refreshing that she's bringing duwop back into mainstream "
"You tell it girl! I love her lyrics and I love her style. Classic tunes full of modern self 
esteem, confidence and cuteness. I can't wait for more songs from her! "
:) She's on the right track cant wait for more music as she improves! 
It was a amazing kids album I hope evrebody likes it 
Awesome Guys you do an awesome job keep it up :) 
Awesome!!!!!! 
"Back to their best Turn it up, sit back and immerse yourself. After a couple of plays I am 
hooked. Everyone has their favourite Muse album for whatever reason. Enjoy 
each one in their own right. Right now I'm enjoying this one. A bonus for 
me, my son bought me the vinyl double album which also looks great...very 
Pink Floyd looking but I'm not complaining. "
"Drones By other band standards: EXCEPTIONAL. By Muse standards: I expected 
better. Only a few songs speak to the musical complexity and originality 
previously showcased. The album's concept sounds edgy but falls flat. 
Instead of originality, the album has mixed audio clips and proven-to-sell 
lyrics made palatable to US teenagers. Bellamy's edginess sounds tamed by 
the industry, and even the token Muse rift can't make this seem little more 
than a homage to their previous work. "
"This is some of the ballsiest albums I've ever had the chance to hear. I 
feel like Muse has moved into Tool/any Maynard territory, where the music 
is always top notch, but the story painted by the lyricist is equal in 
importance. On top of it, imagine any of this live? As Muse always brings 
it, up on another plane "
":D I have been waiting for this album since 2012 when The 2nd Law came out, 
and I swear to the heavens and back it was very much worth the wait. For 
me, it is right up there with Origin of Symmetry (which is my now joint 
favourite album). It tells such a powerful story, and it is a clever mix of 
new and old styles. (I personally love the song Reapers. Definite rec, 
there.) "
"Fantastic Storyline For me this album told the story of a past rough relationship I had and 
helped me move past it. This album goes to show Muse can constantly shake 
up their routine and kill it doing so! Great guitar great drums great bass! 
You wont be disappointed "
"My Favorite Muse Album I love the rock sound Muse had on Absolution and Origin of Symmetry, but 
also the more pop sound of The 2nd Law and The Resistance. Drones is my 
favorite because it has both. Reapers, Dead Inside, The Handler and Psycho 
are my favorites. I would strongly recommend a listen. "
"Got it a few days early and this is one fantastic album. It is much closer 
to Absolution and Black Holes and Revelations bringing a lot more heavy 
rock and experimental pieces that will surprise the listener. Some songs 
take a few listens to feel the deep nature of them, but once understood, 
each song is a force to be reckoned with. From the gritty sounds of Handler 
and Psycho to the ear bliss of Aftermath, Mercy, Drone and The Globalist, 
any listener can find gold here. I couldn't recommend it enough. stop 
whatever your doing and BUY THIS ALBUM. "
"Muse Does It Again. The songs with exceptional melodic, harmony, with superb selection of 
lyrics. I always find myself listening to their music as load as I can play 
on ear buds. Then covering my ears to enjoy the full effect that delivers 
all the way to my core or soul. Time is of nothing when listening. "
"Don't get me wrong but I love Muse and I love this album but compared to 
some of their other albums, this one just can't quite compete. Songs such 
as Psycho, The Handler and Dead Inside i can't stop listening to, kinda 
like diamonds in the rough. Buy this album and buy the rest. "
"My favourite muse album to date This treasure trove of filthy muse goodness just passes origins of 
symmetry as my favourite album. The only problem is you get a sense that 
muse listened too much to the people who hated the 2nd law. As good as the 
heavy stuff is I also like Muse's electronic side and would have loved to 
see 1 or 2 electronic songs in here "
"Unfortunate It's unfortunate that this album is so weak (as a whole). I'm not the 
first to say it but aside from a few choice tracks it left me wanting more 
than it was prepared to offer. At least their back catalogue is still up to 
the task. "
"A worthy entry to their Discography I can't recal how many times I skipped a track from MUSE's previous 
effort. With this album the songs seem to stick waaay better. If you have 
listened to MUSE before you can expect those little synth appregios, Dom's 
drum tom thumping, and Queen-like vocals. The biggest let down is that the 
energy wanes a bit towards the middle. Still Drones is a much more valiant 
and solid effort than The 2nd Law. "
"Gotta say I'm a little disappointed Yes Muse is an awesome artist and my favorite, but after listening to 
their music for year, this album feels like is could have been much more 
great. I don't get that same feeling as when listening to their older 
albums. This isn't saying that this album doesn't contain some great songs, 
because it does. "
"Better than what I expected and back to top form Well what can I say seen Muse live 7 times and I was a bit sceptical about 
this new album as I wanted them to go back to heavy stuff, but I really 
like this album back to there best!!!. Psycho Reapers and The Globalist are 
just aswome tracks, can't wait to see them live again!!! "
"Muse has lost the magic They've continued their downward spiral with this one... Just a few decent 
tracks here, and they don't have the longevity of Muse's earlier 
pre-Resistance efforts. "
"If you are already a Muse fan, you will LOVE this album. If you aren't 
already a Muse fan and like amazing music, you will LOVE this album. If you 
are deaf, ignore everything I just wrote because I don't want you feel bad 
for missing out on being able to hear this album. If you are temporarily 
deaf, let this be the first thing you listen to when you become undeaf. If 
you are a drone, you will not like this album. 5/5, will listen again... 
and again, and again, and again... and again, and again, and again, and 
again. AND AGAIN. "
"YES!! This album is awesome! It tells a story throughout. Good mix of rock and 
even a little pop-rock. Drones was a little.... well... it's a capella. 
Yeah. It grew on my though! The entire album is awesome! Haters are dumb. 
Yes it isn't anything new.... but I like the sound. "
"One of the Best In my opinion, this is the best album Muse have produced since BH&R, with 
almost every track being a classic. I haven't ever actually had a muse 
album where there hasn't been a track I dislike, and it's the same story 
here. On showbiz it was escape, OOS it was screenager, Absolution it was 
ruled by secrecy, BH&R it was soldiers poem, The resistance it was guiding 
light and on 2nd law it was explorers. On drones however, it has been the 
only album with more than one song I would instantly skip, with 3. "
"#showmeyourwarface An album of epic proportions. Opinion to opinion is a mixed bag but to me 
this is definitely top 3 of muse best. I'm so happy that Muse have gone for 
a heavier sounding album much like linkin park did with the hunting party 
and maybe an influence or two from how awesomely rocking royal bloods debut 
album was. Personal highlights are psycho, the handler & defector + mercy 
gave me a starlight vibe & reapers can only be listened one way: LOUDLY!!!! "
"I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I have listened to Muse for a while now, and I've heard all of their 
albums. I'm so glad they've gone back to their old style opposed to the 2nd 
Law album. This album is so great! I've been listening to it for weeks. I 
love it "
"It's OK I love these guys. But gotta say I wasn't really wowed with this one. 
Probably 3 or 4 good tracks, the rest are somewhat subpar. I went back to 
The 2nd Law after listening to this one. "
"An amazing album. I loved this album. It was way more than I could have expected. But it's 
so unfortunate that my pre-order was mysteriously cancelled against my will 
and I had to find other means to finally listen to it. "
"In all seriousness, these guys are great musicians! However, this album 
sounds like all of their previous albums with a dash of buttrock riffs to 
make it sound like it's different from the others. This is isn't 
progressive rock. It's regressive rock. "
"A good album by it's own right...but with only 3 or 4 memorable tracks it's 
one of Muse's weaker outings. There are some solid 'classic' Muse riffs as 
well as moments that remind us of Absolution and Black Holes, but overall 
most of the tracks feel uninspired and smell of a meddling producer. "
"Amazing album I've been a big fan of Muse since 2003! every song on this album flows 
together and tells a story of rebellion, kings and queens, and government 
conspiracies. "
"Meh and slow Why so slow....putting me to sleep. His voice needs a tone down since the 
music is way better. He is part of the band not the best part. One song 
even sounds exactly like a previous song sung. Dissapointing. I loved their 
earlier stuff and still wish I could mute his vibrato long notes. Geez. "
"This is such an amazing album and I absolutely love all the songs, which is 
usually rare for me. It features a nice blend of pure rock with influences 
from music pioneers in general, or at least that's what I hear. 
Additionally, the album has a compelling story, told from song number one 
all the way to the very last track, a fact you can see just by looking at 
the songs' titles. Listen to the lyrics and you have a complete saga. For 
any fan of Muse, this is a must. For everyone else, this is also a must. 
Enjoy! "
"Muse got rid of 90% of electronics and got back to basics. Guitar, base and 
drums. The album is perfect and in the same ballpark as Resistance and 
Black Holes and Revelations. "
"This album is awesome Starts off with a mixture of rock music, gets a bit heavier before 
becoming relaxing, almost Pink Floydish, it's awesome, wasn't too sure 
about ""Drones"" as acapella, but it's a unique way for Muse to close a fine 
album. Good stuff. My favorite is Defector. "
"Another Solid Album This album really grew on me after a couple of listen throughs. Definitely 
recommend. "
"Great but... This album has some amazing songs like psycho and dead inside which hark 
back to their origins like what was promised. However other songs like 
mercy, though amazing, don't fit the same genre and whilst most are good, 
Revolt is quite possibly the worst song I've heard all year which is a real 
shame. Also as JFK, Drill Seargeant and Drones aren't really tracks, be 
aware you'll only be getting 9 actual songs. But it's Muse so still worth 
it "
"Solid album Doesn't blow me away, but the last two albums I grew into over time until 
I picked up the addiction - this may happen here. The only song I dislike 
is dead inside which feels flatter than the normal Muse roller coaster - 
great video though "
"Yet another masterpiece! I love this album so much. The songs are a great mixture of what made 
their old albums great and the new sounds of their newer ones. And the 
theme of the lyrics is also very relevant. You won't regret getting it! "
"Chris Very disappointed! I was hopping and expecting so much..oh well ""UPDATE"" 
After a few listens, I have completely changed my mind! I now live it "
"I'm completely disappointed with this album. Tons of cliche. Music is poor 
and dull. I think Muse should step aside from politics. There is nothing 
memorable about this album. Sad. "
"Returned to their roots This is Muse returning to their glory days of OoS and Absolution. 
Completely stoked with this new album. Turn it up loud! "
"The best rock band I can't get enough of how awesome muse's songs sound. Without a doubt they 
are the best alternative/rock band of the century "
Too Expensive Good band but not worth paying a premium for their music. 
"The Globalist This album has everything you love from muse. Though a weird last song 
(Drones) everything else is put together fantastically. Get ready to catch 
yourself singing the lyrics, tapping your foot, playing air guitar with an 
imaginary Matt Bellamy, and headbanging constantly to the museic. "
"Wonderful story with amazing melodies First listen through made me question if it was actually Muse, but I loved 
every second of future play throughs. Each track is great on its own and 
complement each other when played in order. Definitely pleased with this 
album! "
"Lovely Beats. I get the problem people have,(imo) since kaleidoscope dream had his voice 
utilised more. While wildheart has ""beautiful exit, waves, leaves"" with 
catchy beats good vocals as always that are forgettable & synthesizers and 
not enough of miguel's voice. Coffee among Nwa and HD remind me of 
kaleidoscope dream/art dealer chic esque type songs like adorn or all. I 
reaally wanna hear them live since he always kills it. I still love the 
album though and still a fan. I just know he can do better. :)♥ "
"<3 Miguel ITS not like his other work because he is an artist. He's evolving. He 
can't stay the same. He's different and that's what I love about him. I 
love "" Coffee "" ""Leaves "" ""a beautiful exit "" ""simple things "", ""what's 
normal anyway ""... Man.. I hope to see you in concert! I'm pleased with 
this album!!! <3 "
"This album is trash!!! Anyone that gave this album 5 stars knows nothing about music. I'm tired 
of r&b soul albums sounding like their singing rap lyrics!!! Today's music 
is so bad and this generation should be ashamed! "
"It's worth the purchase. Coffee, Waves and NWA are my favorite songs on the album. Although it's 
not like his first two I enjoyed the album. "
"Expected Better I'm a big Miguel fan and this album just really disappointed me. I've been 
waiting for his album for the longest and this is a DROP from Kaleidescope 
Dream "
"I'm really not sure what happened here. 'All I Want Is You' was pretty 
solid. 'Kaleidoscope Dream' was a remarkable follow-up. 'Wildheart' is just 
underwhelming. I kinda want a refund. "
"Miguel wild heart By far Miguel's best work to date. It's the kinda of album you could throw 
on and chillax to. Or for some baby making music. "
"5 star officially the album starts off good and then keep going u will come back for more of 
miguel's..my number one will be 'simple things' second coffee is a topper 
indeed (: no doubt. #summertime "
"Best R&B Album of 2015 Prince+Lenny+Santa with a pinch of Miss Lauryn Hill you get this amazing 
artist. Miguel has always been ahead of his time and he proves it once 
again with Wild Heart. "
"Don't sleep People need to give this another listen if they don't like it because it 
is a remarkable album. Can't believe the 1 star ratings. 5 out of 5. "
"Great Am I the only one that didn't get the album art?? I'm disappointed that 
its blank "
"I like it He mad the mood of the album so you can have sex to it and you should be 
able to last the length of the album. If not then maybe you wouldn't like 
the album. I probably wouldn't either if I were you whom ever you may be "
Not as good as his other albums Older albums are much more unique. This one is OK. 
"Not happy This is not good at all wasn't a good follow up to the last album the last 
album was fire "
Lame Haven't heard anything this lame since ever. 
Unacceptable This album us a disgrace to mankind I'm sorry 
This is music? Horrible. Just horrible. I can't believe this guy has a deal. 
"True Art Although nothing will ever compare to Kaleidescope dreams this one will 
give you pleasure just as easily! "
Better than kaleidoscope dream. Classic album. I can listen to this album 4-5 times in a row and not know. 
"I like it. I don't really care for about 3 tracks on here. Flesh is the standout 
track here. "
Love I really like his work. Wish he received more success. 
Its okay Not my favorite album from him but still a good album. 
???? Not sure what he was going for with this album. I was really disappointed. 
"Its a pretty good album Nothing is always going to be the same but music grows on you just like 
this album did. "
Just ridiculous Crazy good album. 
It's Ok I only like 2 songs from the whole CD...and they are ok. 
Omg I love miguel si much more than any one does in this world 
What is he touching can I have sex with you 
Gorgeous!! I can't stop listening to them and I just...UGH! Just 
Big masterpiece comeback for Miguel 
Can't play at all. Bought the whole album of miguel. Can't play at all. Zero star. 
"Great This is a nice c d his music is different from everybody else.....he's 
original "
It's different i guess... coffee my favorite song uhh yeah that is all 
Obsessed Miguel Killed it 
Psychodelic mumbling Wtf 
"Awesome!! I loveeeee this album!! Loving the new sound!! Wonderful voice and truly 
enjoying Miguel's growth as an artist!! "
"Awesome Truly a great album ""Do Not Sleep On This One"" "
Coffee I love coffee amazing Miguel I'm a huge fan of yours 
Wildheart His concert in Atlanta was just amazing. Great artist 
Nah Its not bad but its not what i was expecting from him maybe his next album 
"Mjj I love you This album is a fantastic collection of his music from early to late. I 
listen to it every day apart from when my fiancé threatens to throw it out 
the window. He just doesnt understand! I love you MJ. "
"L.O.V.E Omg before I knew him I would never know I would find another great singer 
after I started hating Justin Beiber lol!!! I REALLY hope he didn't die if 
he didn't I would probably have his autograph hanging on my bedroom wall by 
now I luv u "
in the closet yes i will dare u michael! mmmm <3 
"God bless Michael R.I.P Michel may he rest in heaven amen. I love the song bad now it my 
most fav now. "

"The world needs Michael Jackson This music was my childhood, I love Michael Jackson really wish he

"I like to listen to all of Michael Jackson songs anyway too. I like to listen to all of Michael Jackson songs are wonderful and amazing 
rock and roll singer and he is a very good looking man who is a good rock 
and roll singer and he is very talented and amazing rock and roll singer 
and he is a very good daddy and he will be missed by all of his fans and 
that's why because he was a very good rock and roll singer and we will be 
missing Michael Jackson songs and his ways of performing all of songs with 
a good attitude toward all of fans like the good ways of how he was a very 
good rock and roll singer anyway too too too too too too too too too. "
"Shes Out Of My Life! Seems like he took my feeling about my late mothers death, and put it into 
words! "
"Man In The Mirror MAN IN THE MIRROR is a great song for relaxing and sleeping, not to LOUD 
or SOFT or HIGH BEAT just right, you're technically just -Playin it Cool-

Aaliyah The best thing about it is that I know all of Michael Jackson's songs . 
"Mikey I love you Michael Jackson, I just wish I had been able to go to one of

"YASSS!!!! I love MJ and his songs are amazing!!! 1 out of 1,000, I would pick

"Michael Jackson MARION Because of your music I have not felt quite alone...I love you!! Rest in 
peace! ! "
"ahowze I agree, this is the greatest song that I have ever heard "
"BEST ALBUM EVER This is the best album ever produced by em by FAR. People say he went 
soft, but that's complete bull. One listen to cold wind blows and u know 
he's not soft. I have been a hardcore die hard Stan since 4th grade, and I 
know the real slim shady and this is him. This, (Recovery), The Marshall 
Mathers LP, the eminem show, and The Marshall Mathers LP2 are the real em 
speaking amazing lyrics. Not the fake em, on drugs. Anyway, DEFINITELY 
WORTH THE 11.49!!!!!!!! "
"Eminem at his best. This album is a master piece I thank god we have rapper's like Eminem not 
many can compare to him. This is his best album up to date. That album he 
dropped called ""The Hell Sequel"" wasn't that great. EMINEM'S - RECOVERY 
ALBUM SHOWS EMINEMS,TRUE PASSION TOWARDS HIP-HOP / RAP. "
"Eminem recovery I have always been a fan Of Eminem and whenever I heard that he changed 
his flow so I had to check it out.. I liked it compared to what everyone 
was telling me I know a lot of people gave up on Eminem after relapse but I 
liked it it was more of the old em more darker then what normal is use to 
coming from Eminem here lately like with 3 am or medicine ball but hey 
everyone has their own taste in music .. Also glad to here that he is 
getting his life together.. Hope to hear more from em soon :-) "
"Eminem's Recovery This Album Was Pretty Good. Now First things first. The pros of this 
album. PROS: now this album is really good, he's got a nice flow, amazing 
lyrics, very witty punchlines, and (kinda) the beats, cause some of the 
beats are just meh. Now to get on the Coins. CONS: Guest Appearances from 
basically all the artist I don't like. The Beats like I said before are 
sometimes meh. Summing it all up the albums pretty good but will never be 
as good as his first 3 albums. My favorite song one there is ""so bad"". "
"Loving the difference I love it whn I hear the difference in styles tht Marshall puts into his 
style n levels of his rapping... I am amazed with what he creates n I 
always look forward to how Marshall improves on his own lyrics n levels of 
talent!!! Great Job... Marshall!! I knew yu could do it... Keep up the hard 
work n always kno tht yu hav what it takes to make it to the next level of 
challenges....!! "
"Good album Im not a rap or hip hop fan. However theres some intriguing about how raw 
his music is. On some level i can relate.. The great thing about music is 
it is way for people to expresss them selfs. Not all music is great or 
healthy to listen too. But he is truley being real and that says alot. So 
for people to to negative you are completey missing the point of his 
music.... "
"Eminem once again proves why he is one of the Best The fact Relapse and this album were recorded so close together is 
amazing. I believe Relapse is just as good and Eminem proves his lyrics are 
untouchable. He brings so many hits on this CD and this is THE best 
purchase you can make of any album period. You will not be disappointed and 
probably will be surprised because I believe it to be his best album yet. "
"Perfection Eminem is the best hands down no questions asked no second guessing no 
nothing. He's the best. But he needs to release that new album redemption 
soon! I've listend to all of songs so many times now I've memorized them 
all! So hurry with this new album man! "
"Recovery is an amazing album! I love it completely and some of the best songs are Seduction, Not Afraid, 
Almost Famous, and Cold Wind Blows. I also have something to say to the 
haters. Look, people have their own opinions and not everyone is going to 
agree with you. Please understand that. Thanks. "
"Great album @juventino: you're comment would make more sense if you knew how to spell. 
But I agree that there are some rappers who lost it all, but eminem still 
has it. So instead of stereotyping every rapper, and making yourself sound 
like the retard, make sure you know what you're talking about. "
"Recovery Album Any & All EMINEM is the bomb!!!!! Can't get enough........it don't take me 
long to memorize his records, and really enjoy him. He makes me laugh, at 
his rhymes, and relate to his pain and experiences. Give him a chance, he 
is so similar and relatable, he has a very sweet side also. True Fan right 
here......Tabitha. "
"Good album but different than the rest. Recovery has a good selection of tracks and nice lyrics, however, the 
album is different as the beats are different than the older albums and 
some of the lyrics are either good or sub-par, hence the four stars. 
Overall, Recovery is a very good album. Although it may not be perfect, its 
still a comeback for the veteran rapper. "
"Recovery No question one of the greatest hip hop albums there is. Instead of being 
like all the other rappers and talk about drugs, Eminem shares his 
addiction and how much of a struggle it was. And how anyone else can follow 
him down the same rode of recovery. Without a doubt 5 stars. "
"Eminem is so bad, that he's so good!!! I loved this entire album - 10 stars!! Eminem is truly a gifted & 
incredible person. Em's work has many healing properties. I love that when 
you listen to his music again a new layer is unveiled. The negative/false 
reviews on here are definitely too personal - listen to Em's lyricism & 
growth. Em is not a ""poppy sensation"". I don't actually purchase CDs or 
downloads & I ignore the radio but for Eminem I am invested. I write poetry 
& I immediately connected with his lyrics. Marshall stay strong . "
"Not his best I like his new album much better than this one, he gives off this vibe 
that slim shady is dead on this album but i'll give the benefit of the 
doubt that he does have a couple of good songs off here. But other than 
that I didn't care for the album at all "
"Lyrically amazing, music you can feel. Every time I listen to this album I pick up on a metaphor I never caught 
on to before. I've read many bad reviews of this album and I don't get it. 
Either people just don't want to like it, or they just don't listen to the 
lyrics because some of three wordplay on this album is incredible. "
"Amazing The album is awsome. It's definitely better than his previous 2 albums 
relapse and encore. I recommend getting this if you haven't already. I'd 
say cold wind blows, on fire, and space bound are the best songs off this 
album. "
"Way to go!! How can you people hate on EMINEM... Saying he sucks and that everyone 
else is stupid for listening to this and that he is white? Ima break this 
down for you guys... Maybe you have the bad taste in music and not the 
other one million people you just called out. And if my first statement 
it's true which it is why are we the stupid ones?? We have the good taste. 
And who gives a flying F*** if he's white... Grow the hell up and notice 
that anyone can be anything... Even a multi-platinum rapper. I rest my 
case. "
"A real review. I'm a hardcore Eminem fan, and have been since I was in 2nd grade. Don't 
get me wrong, anything produced by Em is brilliant, but this is nothing 
like Slim Shady. Real fans know this isn't his best "
"Great but not his best I'm I really big Eminem fan. This is by no means his best album, however 
this is still a great album. I'd say my favorite albums by him the Eminem 
show and MMLP2. But what songs make this album so great in my opinion is No 
Love and Not Afraid. "
"Eminem: Best at the Technical aspect of Hip-Hop Every song is full of the best word play, flow, metaphors, and story 
telling you'll hear. There is a reason no Artist comes after Eminem. He is 
the best alive. You can easily listen to the whole album with out skipping 
a song. If you've ever been through a big struggle in your life you'll 
appreciate this album. "
"Great You either like this album or you don't. Slim Shady isn't a big part of 
this album but make no mistake, the Marshall persona is just as good. 
Upbeat tempo and great music. Not his best work but it's way better than 
Encore and Relapse. "
"Reality check This album is amazing. I cant understand why people complain about it. Yet 
there out there listening to crap like little wayne and PSY. I cant believe 
a korean artist blew up in the USA. You guys are all pathetic "
"NO WORDS Hater if you cant say anithing good about eminem shut youre pie hole cause 
at 40 yrs. He still the best and he always will "
"Real Hardcore fan of Eminem... I see alot of ppl saying this wasnt his ""best"" or not that great or miss 
the old slim shady...I dont give a hoot! Allll his songs are amazing to me! 
I ABSOLUTELY adore this goddamn man! Since I was a little kid when my 
parents pretty much grounded me whenever they heard me playing any of his 
songs in my room was so worth it!!! In MY opinion this album is incredible! 
Just his lyrics on his real life experiences is what really had me fall in 
love with him. Shady till I die!!! "
"Let's be honest Someone who considers their self a true fan can't criticize the master at 
works, work I mean come on your not selling millions so don't be rude just 
because you don't like something, personally I think Em reached a new level 
of modernism with his new stuff and it's quite amazing. "
"@Juventino If u don't like it, then there's no need to tell the whole world. I agree 
with you there are some awful rappers. But there's about one or two good 
tracks on here. "
"Greatness I been listening to eminem since his first album was out. This last album 
is his best masterpeice yet. More meaning behind his music. For the ppl 
hating, dnt listen plain n smple "
"Great Lyrics I like every Eminem album beside Encore and Relapse, but how ever he was 
on drugs on those albums. My favorite song on this album is Cold Wind Blow 
and my all time favorite is Superman "
"Love it It is true that I just love Eminem, but this album is awesome and most 
Eminem fans would say: You don't know the real good albums by Eminem. Well 
I do,but there is something in this album that makes me like it a lot maybe 
the lyrics. I don't know. It's an awesome album download it !!!! "
"Fan Since Soul Intent! I noticed people claiming this is not like his old work. This rather 
sounds like Infinite and SI days when he first started. Definitely one of 
his best imo since it has a feel of his actual old albums which I love. "
"Naht dat good I lkked eminems old songs like lose yorself and stan and toy soldiers and 
so on not much a fan of any surely hes done better I only like ""not afraid"" 
evetything else sucks sry but it does I know he could have done better but 
I think this is his only bad album "
"Yessss!!! Eminem is by far the best rapper! Even tho this cd doesn't have Slim 
Shady, its still one of his best! I love Cold Wind Blows, Cinderella Man, 
Space Bound, and Won't Back Down! "
"To the commenter below me. First form a complete thought, then put that thought into a sentence. A 
sentence that can be understood. Before you can call someone stupid, make 
sure that you, yourself isn't indeed stupid. You hate on people for liking 
music? Sure not all rap is good, but Eminem has an intelligence in his 
lyrics rarely seen by other rappers. Not all rap music is the same, don't 
listento it if you don't like it. It's that simple. "
"not slim shady, but rappers /people evolve. it's not psychotic slim, but he still is has 
an intriguing way of telling a story. not just making words rhyme in time 
eat a lime and think it's great "
"The best Eminem album ever I can truly say that Recovery is my #1 favorite album by Eminem he killed 
the Slim Shady gimmick & just became a positive Eminem off drugs & became 
hella lyrical Recovery is when Eminem made his comeback NOT MMLP2 my least 
favorite Eminem album is Relapse he totally could have did better with that 
one but I was a lil disappointed when he went back to Slim Shady he should 
have stayed as Recovery Eminem fact not an opinion. "
"Can't really go wrong You can't go wrong with Eminem. Still my least favorite album of his. Way 
different. Still an amazing album in and of itself. Favorite song has got 
to be Not Afraid, but the rest are pretty good too "
"Would pay any amount of $$... ...to somehow be Eminem's thoughts in his skull for 1 day, heck 1 
hour...how can 1 man pump out bar after bar, hit after hit, album after 
album all in different voices, styles, tempos, speeds, lyrical mad 
geniusness, rhyming 2,3,4,5... words in 1 line at times, dissecting words 
so that the symmetry is all there all while staying true to his art's 
common theme of controversy, anger, addiction AND not once using the N word 
like EVERY rapper out there has to in order for words to rhyme...how?! He 
simply is amazing, doesn't get enough credit if that's even possible... "
"Best Hip Hop Album Maybe Ever Call me old fashioned but I liked the days when hip hop had, you know, 
lyrics. Crazy, I know. Better than Curtain Call. He lost it for a while and 
came back harder than ever before. Might be the best album ever. "
"Dam!!! He proved there is not one person that is even on or near the planet he is 
lircaly . He is lircaly the greatest MC ever PERIOD!! So u that dont get it 
take Big L, Biggie ,Tupac,Rakim, T.l, Outkast, with Dre back most beats. 
Wrap it up. No one puts it down like Eminem. The way he puts tracks 
together is lircaly untouched . Its heart mind blood sweat tears and pain 
put in a way noone can touch. "
"FRICKEN LOVE IT I love this album so much! The quality is so good. People were telling me 
that live albums don't sound good but this album impressed me! Still can't 
get over the fact that it's placed under the ""pop, teen pop, 10's pop"" 
category but I'll live. "
"I love 5Sauce This band and there music helps you through most of your problems anad 
there the vest looking band in the world. This album just shows how amazing 
they are and how much support the 5sos fam has for them. I love you 5SOS xx "
"I love them and their music a lot. Its so out there that they don't want to 
be known as a boy band, but a rock band. And they can get to that level! So 
proud of them. Fan from the beginning! "
"No I don't love this album I'm obssesed with 5sos not like stalker obsessed (chill out) I'm addicted 
to your music basically I listen to it all the time and when my teacher 
named her son Calum,i literally flipped out lol I love 5SOS "
"5sos is the best Im so happy i bought this its like experiencing them live all over again 
when i went to there concert at the forum on the 16th. Honestly no regrets, 
ive loved them for 2 years now and i can never explain how proud i am of 
them for everything they have accomplished. They literally make my life a 
billion times better and they brighten up my day when ever im feeling down. 
This album was a genuine idea they came up with for all the fans that 
haven't got to see them in concert, which is really cool. "
"Wow! American Idiot and Teenage Dream! And they actually sound good...... 
everyone can love 5SOS.. I'm not a girl and they're still good... lol xD :) "
"Literally amaze balls I never thought I would love this kind of music but when I heard 5sause 
for the first time I fell in love. It was always just ❤One Direction❤ for 
me but now thanks to them I have discovered my other boys. I love them so 
much and I'm so proud of how far they have come. Amazing work. I love their 
music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.❤❤❤ "

"Luv 5SOS!! Im so happy I got this. For the past weeks this is all I listen to now. 
EEEEEEEEP! I cant wait to go to their concert in Perth. Luv these 4 idiots 
:) "
"Baes I love them so much. I wish I could see them but its hard when you have 
financial problems "
"Is It Hi or Hey? I have been a fan since the hemmo1996 days. I've been here longer then 
Ash. Now that they are becoming huge! Sometimes I feel sad because they 
aren't a secret anymore, but I also feel like a proud momma... "
"THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD. I NORMALLY DONT LIKE LIVE VERSIONS OF SONGS BUT I 
ENJOY HOW THE FANS SCREAMS ARE LOWERED AND YEAH. "
"Why!! Why do you guys have to kill so many people with great music and such 
beautiful faces like holy fuck, did u know that you can go to jail for

"broke af I haven't listened to it yet but I know it's gonna be great even without

"Looveee this The only reason I'm not buying it is cos it reminds me of how I'm not

"OMG!!!! YES!!! This is the best band live in the world im telling you. Its like listening 
to the studio version but with screaming girls in the background. Love it

career in this album. "
"THIS ALBUM IS BOMB I LOVE THIS SO MUCH BECAUSE IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, YOU'RE ACTUALLY 
THERE!!! THIS IS SO UNIQUE. NOT MANY ARISTA DO THINGS LIKE THIS "
"If there isnt moments of Michael Clifford or Ashton Irwin 
grunting/screaming....I'll want a refund. "

I might not ever see them in concert!!!! I love you 5so!!! "
MY BOYS ❤ I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS YOU HAVE NO IDEA OKAY I'M NOT EMOTIONALLY STABLE 
"I ♥ One Direction. Liam, Harry, Louis, Niall and Zayn if your reading just 
know I love you guys and that this is the best album ever!! Great album!! I love One Direction because they always put so much effort 
in to please their fans. They always give what they do their all. The 
haters are just jealous that they don't have talent like 1D do. I'd like to 
see the haters go away on tour for months on end and leave their families 
behind. One Direction don't rely on their obvious good looks, they put in 
every effort to make songs with meaning. Just because they have 
extraordinHARRY lives doesn't mean they are any different from the rest of 
us. "
"Bro Just saw your Midnight Memories album with more songs on it! Why? Why 
would you do this??? Oh my gosh DX. Ugh. Well, see ya later. I'm off to buy 
that album. Keep up the good work and happy holidays <3 "
"Wow the new Beatles! Bow down, everyone.. Guess if these are the modern equivalent of the Beatles, then Bieber is 
the new Bob Dylan. Seriously though, is there a point to this other than to 
make loads of money for a bunch of guys with very limited talent? An 
artistic statement, not. "
"OMG ILYSM I just love One Direction sooo much! They have done sooo much for me. I 
know we haven't met yet but we will someday. They dramatically changed my 
life and idk what I would do without them. ~Harry's mine~ sorry I crushed 
your dreams haha "
"Great Album People that are giving this album an rating below 4 stars are just dumb. 
This album is NOTHING like the first 2. They grown and matured. Don't 
believe me? Listen to WMYB then listen to little white lies, you'll see the 
difference. "
"Trent Cullum You need to be put in your place, 1D are amzayning they are no wannabes. 
They are internation superstars, best song ever is called that because 
their saying to dance to the best song ever. And anyway i haven't heard you 
sing, so if you think you can sing go on the X factor! (P.S. im a 
Directioner) "
"I am crying sooooooooooo much. I can't take this. I love you boys you make 
me happy when I'm sad l what you to stay l what you to stay ohohohohohoh I love 1D really much i'm a fan of them. Like other fans. I love you 1D 
I'm a fan but I do not like the ones who didn't like the ones who do not 
like them. I do not like the direction naters. Good job boys. God bless 
direction naters "
"My daughter loves it OK my daughter is like in love with them. She loves their music. She told 
me her dream is to finally meet them. She is so obsessed. Also they said 
he'd name in the best song ever video. She almost cried "
"I'm crying its so amazing One direction I love you so much. These songs have meanings to them and 
its not just crap songs withought a meaning. Onece again you have made 
another amazing album and made your directioners proud to be directioners. "
"Its fine My only problem is that in order to get every song on the album you have 
to pay like 4 more dollars. On the regular one they tip you of four songs. 
Its so stupid I'm actually really irritated "
"So proud I am <3 Love this ,amazing album so far best album going ane just because people 
dont like one direction theres no need to call them what have the done to 
you nothing! Disgusting people calling them just because they dont one 
direction it like me callin black veil brides anyways I love you guys keep 
going in life you amazing you made me smile every day I love you Harry E 
Styles xx<3 <3 <3 "
"Used to love them They're growing up and I'm not really into them that much. I used to have 
1d towels, dressing gown, fleece and loads of other 1d stuff but now they 
just bore me. Sorry 1d "
"My daughter is not even 3 yet but she adores One Direction. If she's not 
listening to the songs shes watching the videos....had to order her a 
tshirt today :-) Fab "
"I love you one direction They've been so brave and strong taking all the hate and flushing it all 
away! They've also learnt a lot and I bet all directioners will agree with 
me! Seriously I know it sounds cheesy but they've literally turned my life 
upside down! I don't know what I'd do without them!!!!! Haters are going 
dooowwwwwnnnn! "
"... My friend loves this band and she told me to buy the album. I listened to 
it first. These songs are the most mainstream, overplayed songs on the 
radio. All they sing is love songs. They're not very deep ones, either. I'd 
rate it 0 stars if I could. "
"Amazing!!!!!:-) I absolutely love them! Their albums get better and better! To all those 
haters just take a second to listen to their music. And I bet you won't say 
that they are the worst band ever again! "
"Great. Perfect. IDK. Im barely hearing it now but its amazing boys you did an amazing job wity 
thus album I can already see everyobe saying great things on midnight 
memories Im just so proud of you guys thank you Niall Louis Liam Zayn & 
Harry thank you for making a muxh better person and addinf happiness in my 
life ♡ "
"Best Album Ever!!! I♡1D This album is AMAZING!!! I mean like they are all ages between 19-21. To 
do ALL of this in such young ages is fantastic, hats off to them!!! I feel 
sooooo proud that I am a directioner! I Some people make fun of 1D and I 
tell them you have no right to make fun of One Direction! Now that is the 
reason why I ♡ One Direction and their new album Midnight Memories!!!!! 
I♡1D! xx I would also like to add that I L♥VE Harry Styles!♡!♡!♡!♡!♡! "
"Wow Im a complete directioner and ANYONE who thinks this album is bad needs to 
get there ears checked!!! Its much better than there old ones because they 
get better as they go on!!! THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD!!! "
"There's nothing better than this album! Ok this album is pure perfection. I've been a proud directioner for a long 
time and this album is PERFECT, so sorry... your arguement is invalid. :) 
~Niam Girl x "
"I love One Direction! Their music is getting better and better as they get older! Compare What 
makes you beautiful to Midnight Memories or Happily it has matured since 
then. I love you and never stop! "
"Hate there music I hope your reading this one direction Your music makes my ears bleed it is the crapyist music I have ever 
heard.you are the worst band I have a burning pashin for hating your band 
it's so stupid I hope you actually to your music next time. Look actually 
sing next time. Yours truly the one direction hater "
"Horrific Just appalling. What is the music industry coming to. I have more talent 
in my left testicle 0/5 stars "
SO BAD! They Are Just In It For The Money ! Ha! Best Song Ever? More Like Worst 
"I LOVE YOU ONE DIRECTION!!! I love this album it always makes me think of Larry. I hope Larry 
Stylinson comes out soon because Eleanor is just a piece of . Anyway, im in 
5th rade and my senior trip is tomorrow! I LOVE YOU LARRY STYLINSON!!!! "
"Extremely bland I might actually like 'Story of My Life' if it wasn't so overplayed. As 
for 'Midnight Memories', I don't understand how anyone could listen to it, 
let alone enjoy it. "
"ONE DIRECTION I CRYED LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. SECOND BEST ALBUM FOUR IS THE BEST THAT 
MADE ME CRY WHEN I GOT IT NOW I HAVE ALL OF THEY ALBUMS "
"Best album yet Im so proud of 1D because they learned alot over the years and they're 
carear has gone far and i know that they have worked very hard on this 
album thats why its so good "
"I love it I love their music and songs, they have made another great album. GO ONE 
DIRECTION! And for you haters GET YOUR EARS CHEKED "
"NO NO NO! Don't even think about saying that i suck. I FLIPPING HATE THIS BAND! ITS NOTHING BUT G4Y CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP 
CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP!!! WORST BAND KNOWN TO MAN. AND YOU G4Y 
BOY BAND LOVERS BETTER NOT ARGUE WITH ME! They have greasy hair with lice. 
Also need to die in hell! Weird thing, ""best song ever"" hah!!! Talk about 
so called! ALL 1D HATERS, JOIN MY ANTI 1D CLAN!!! "
"Fact One direction is worse than garbage. Don't waste your money on this 
rubbish. I feel like my ears will fall off when I listen to them. Who even 
buys this trash? "
"Sorry but... In my opinion the song midnight memories sounds like a high school musical 
song. I dont know why but I hate one direction :/ sorry directioners. You 
inly like their looks! Sorry if I have it wrong but, yeah. Im part of 'the 
wanted fanmily' because of their amazing music. Their music actually has 
meaning! "
"Directioner forever! I love their music. To the people who send hate to them, you're 
irrelevant. Kay, byee. "
"Albume,midnight memories 1D is sooo great,I totally love it,and for those who don't like 
them,there's something called respect for other people,keep your commemts 
to yourself,you don't have to spread it everywhere,act like a mature person 
for Gods sake,ughhh "
"Best album ever The best album by the most talented guys (especially you harry!!!!!!!) 
Anyone who says its at all bad must not have heard it :-) you mean the 
world to me guys (harry the most) keep on being amazing xx (Diana, happily, 
strong and you & I are my faves) "
"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Once again, One Direction has made me soooo proud to be a Directioner. I 
love them all so much an d I cannot wait to go to their concert next year. 
All 5 of these boys are extremely talented and their music is so 
beautifully written and sung. Thank you Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis 
Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Liam Payne for making me happy for all these 
years, and many more to come!!! This is definately an absolutely amazing 
album! <3 "
"Album of the year ♥ At their young ages, they have achieved so much. 2 world tours and 1 
upcoming world stadium tour, 3 albums, the best fan base ever and tonnes of 
cash. This is definitely their best album yet and i will be buying it on 
all devices capable of downloading it. Good job boys ♥ "
"Midnight Memories How can you not love these lads! They're so talented & gorgeous to boot! I 
am a Mum Directioner & my girls love them too! I liked them first! "
"Worst Band Ever Best song ever? Holy think-a-lot-of-yourselves, batman! Man someone needs 
to put these wannabes in their place. Almost as bad as pus-tin beaver and 
miley 'waste of space ' Cyprus "
"Crap Most of my friends like this crap. Get the taste for Black Veil Brides 
there not much older and are awesome. "
"CLASSIC STRAIT Another classic album by ""The King of Country"" this one I can listen to a 
lot while having a cold beer & talking with a friend or several of my 
friends. Which sounds ironic since that is the name of the album itself. A 
Cold Beer Conversation. LOL :-) "
Cold Beer Conversations Pure fantastic! 
"The King of Country, forever They just don't get any better than this boys and girls. "
Cold Beer Conversation Long live the King that is all. Respect 
"George Strait Simply amazing!!! This is true country with meaning, not hip-hop with 
twang (Luke Bryan). "
"Good album George is Classic country singer! Great album. The more you listen to
