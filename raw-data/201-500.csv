music. Someone please fix this "
"Great Album There are a couple mediocre songs, but the rest are outstanding. Great 
listen. "
"Cool I'm stuck on which song I like better, fight song by rachel platten or

Wylie "

"I really like 4 singles on this album. I like Nicki as an artist. She does 
very well with her colabs with other artists. Goods singles "
"SPEECHLESS This album is by far the best of Nicki's three albums. Her three albums 
are all magnificent masterpieces; however, this album is more emotional 
than its precursors, yet it still has songs to ""Turn Up"" while listening. 
Great job Nicki on making yet another great album. Well worth the wait. "
"QUEEN SLAYING This album is dynamic!! My favourite is probably ""I lied"". There's just so 
much amazingness in one album of magicness! Love u Onika, see you March 
28th! "
"Some songs are good but not all My favorites are: All Things Go, I Lied, The Crying Game, Favorite, Buy A 
Heart and Grand Piano. There are also some others that aren't bad: Get On 
Your Knees, Feeling Myself, Only, The Night Is Still Young. The rest was 
unnecessary and made me give this 3 stars "
"Pinkprint Oooooo la la I love you too much I could listen to you all day long only 
is amazing I like all the songs exept truffle butter oo thnx for releasing 
this album it's great xxx "
"Teezy This album was better than I expected . I love nicki from her mic 
presence,flow,charisma, personality & creativity,all that . The production 
fits her well .i was expecting her to tell some stories an get personal but 
she didnt as much as i wanted her to . She did on a few songs , as far as 
love , but other than that not really . All things go is the nicki ive been 
waiting for . But hey she mixed it up which is fine it works for her . This 
is a great album . Theres alot of growth and improvement . 9/10 "
"Her album is awesome I love Nicki minaj she's perfect don't listen to the haters keep going 
your doing an outstanding job "
"Best Album in 2014 This is my very favorite album she has ever done. From beginning to end. I 
want her and Beyonce to do an album together "
"The Pinkprint My fav new jams. Best album thus far! Nicki minaj definitely outdid 
herself. Keep up the fantastic work nicki "
"Nicki's The Best I love Nicki she is the best don't ever sleep on her she the realest out 
here right now she makes you feel her pain and enjoy her happiness all in 
one album you know that's a winner without trying. I will always make her 
proud because that's what she did made all of us proud and a believer. "
"I hate anaconda. But, all the other songs a cool. Im also mad that Jessie 
ware wasn't credited as featured artist in The Crying Game. "
"AWSOME I wouldve put 5 stars but too much swears but my fave song is bed of lies 
but nicki please dont swear because i look up to u ! "
"Pinkprint Yasss freaking amazing. We all know Nicki Minaj.. Now we get to know Onika 
Maraj "
"#AfricanQueen AMAZIN' ma favs are BED OF LIES, ANACONDA(even though I haven't SEEN da 
vid), PILLS N POTION, ONLY, FEELING MYSELF. P.S I get REALLY emotional when 
I listen 2 bed of lies! LAWL!!! "
"This is a good alumb She did so good I live six if her songs on hear but listen to that bass 
though "
"Nothing but Love W.O.W, I feel a lot of emotions in this album. Truly a great artist, I 
would love to see a video for Grand Piano "
"I love this album by Nicki minaj you inspire me so much Onika Tanya Miraj I 
feel u when u sang grand piano I love u and thank u "
"OMG!!! This album truly has something 4 everyone...I give Nicki mad props. Oh & 
Feeling Myself w/ Beyonce should've been a single #IJS "
"Junior I love Nicki Minaj I wish one day I could fly and see NICKI CHECK ON 
11JUNE "
"All of her songs remind me of my last relationship. Its painful and 
pleasurable. Crying game is truth. "
"Jaws dropping!!!! Everything Nicki Minaj touch turns platinum..... love her artwork .... 
I've been w8n on this..... must have... "
"Yassssssssss This CD is sick! I love that Nicki is singing way more and her BARS are TO 
DIE!!! You better werk Miss Nicki this album is AMAZING!!! "
I absolutely love this whole entire album. Nicki really killed it. ❤ 
"She really doesn't act like a Christian,she's probably not....her music is 
not pleasing to God and she shows off way to much skin... "
I love it Speechless. Absolutely touching. I honestly have no words. 
"Real. I connected with alot of the lyrics. I love it. My favorites are All 
Things Go, Grand Piano, The Crying Game, Bed of Lies, and Buy a Heart "
"Awesome! I got a gift card and I wasn't planing on purchasing the whole album. So I 
got a few songs. I started listening to the samples more and ended up 
getting almost the whole album. Wasn't much of Nicki fan before but I'm 
really loving the album! "
Slay Amazing so much feeling in this album. Just wonderful 
"Love I have always loved Nicki and this is one of the many albums she killed! 
Good for anybody! All of the songs are 5 star worthy love u Onika! "
"Excitement Cant wait till monday, ;D album of the year bout to drop, #MADTING "
Loved It! On this album she showed she's not all about sex.You go Nicki. 
"Love this album but Some on the songs I purchased aren't in my library very disappointing 
because I can't believe Google would have me pay for the song yet it's no 
where to be found wtf. "
"This is the PINKPRINT! Her best album so far, hands down. "
I love Nicki Minaj!!! Everything song she writes is a #1 hit. 
Slayeddd Nicki slayed on this album. Grand Piano is my favorite 
"Google U have took my money and only cave me 2 song from my Nicki Minaj album 
""The pink print"" "
"Anaconda pills n potions the night is still young only feeling myself the 
best "
"Sooooo Awesome!!!!! Love you soooo much Nicki the again the beat album in the world just like 
all of your other ones!!!!! "
Got all I got all of the song and it was free yes free word but soooo amazing 
The QUEEN Of Rap Nick Did It Again! Best Album 
"The best rapper He is so inspirational. He inspired me to make a couple of raps but i need 
a producer to help me. My one dream is to meet jcole. And you should listen 
to his therapist collection my favorite is the storm. Just from that song i 
knew he had a future. Cant wait till Kendrick and Cole to drop that album. "
"Hip-Hop is still alive with a Slow Heartbeat J.Cole has delivered an impressive body of work in this album talking real 
life situations rather its his life or yours J.Cole brought back hip-hop "
"I think hip hop needed a artist like j... cole...it don't feel like the new 
school of hip hop artist speak from the heart and have thought behind their 
lyrics like this dude...he's like a Jay-Z, Nas, and a sprinkle of andre 
3000 in one. "
"Cole World. My boy did his thing on this album! If you haven't been on the cole train 
from the beginning and have only listened to his radio stuff you might not 
like this too much. Cole took it back to his Friday night light days! This 
is a classic. It'll make you want to play the album in church because my 
boy Cole preaching on the album!! Each album has gotten Better an better. 
Cole gonna live forever through his music. "
"Real Rap This is what everyone says that they want, rap with meaning. Instead of 
saying it, support it so that record labels know what's up. This is Cole's 
best studio effort, more about lyrics, and less about catchy hooks, which 
is how it should be. Best Rap Album of The Year. "
"Mixtape When are we going to be able to purchase the come up, friday night lights, 
I already got the warm up. I would really appreciate it if google would 
sell those two mixtapes at least "
"Some hilarious, some relatable Tell me which boy you can think of who can't relate to Wet Dreamz. 
Beinging a girl, I find it funny and really uncommon to hear guys express 
themselves like this. But anyways, I really love No Role Modelz, Note to 
Self, and G.O.M.D. Like I said it some are relatable and these are quite 
the example. The world needs more artists like J. Cole. "
"Simba still growing Cole brings us another Solid hip hop album great beats consistent flow and 
solid stories only thing he's missing are skits not sure if we'll ever get 
those "
"No Words As always, great music to listen to especially, No Role Modelz, Love 
Yourz, Apparently.... great album for not features on it. Always Love J. 
Cole!!! "
"Been waiting for this album This album was one of Cole's most personal albums and with that being said 
I believe that many people won't feel its vibe but I completely love it! "
"Truly amazing album!!!! Hands down, this album is on my top 10 list for 2014-2015, when I first 
heard the album, the rhythm and beat was so uptight along with every song 
having a relation to J Cole's past struggles. If you are into tight, 
meaningful, pure rap songs, I highly recommend you buy forest hills 
drive!!! "
"J. Cole there's only one This a real rapper/hip hop artist his lyrics and the way he makes you feel 
an empathy for his the stories he says in his music and the meaning of his 
music unlike all the other rappers out right now that just write songs and 
make albums and songs even year and rush songs or write songs with no 
meaning to just be heard by dumbass this is the real meaning of rap "
"FIRE! He's one of the best and he drops nothing short of great ... This album is 
no different. Every song is great "
"Carolinas Greatest I've been following Cole since '07 and everything he does is a blessing. 
His music really helped me while I was growing up in my early teens. I 
could literally relate to just about everything he spoke. From the struggle 
to making out of the struggle, going to school, females, everything! He 
keeps it real & he gives the people what they want which is real music. Now 
he's about to drop his 3rd album and I can't wait to hear it. - 910 "
"Positive Growth This Album is very different. I think J. Cole takes u on his journey from 
where he's been and gone through to the present. He cleverly plays with the 
beats and makes postive reflective lyrics. Only thing is he needs to work 
on the singing, However stretching yourself is what makes it work. "
"Excellent Even when facing great success from his Born Sinner and The Sideline Story 
albums. J Cole manages to keep his head in the game to produce music that 
is real and not radio driven. To me everyone of his albums are excellent 
works of art that step away from the negative image that modern Rap/Hip hop 
artists bring to this great genre "
"2014 I know it's gonna be dope. Cole is one of the realest artists out and is 
in tune with the people. Ever since I heard Who Dat I went back and did my 
research and got the Come Up and the Warm Up then when Friday Night Lights 
came I got that so I've been a fan for a min. But his music is 
inspirational and helped me in high school and definitely is in college. "
"Becoming a great storyteller Versus just rhyming and making punch lines. Not saying he ever did but 
getting even better which was hard with how good born sinner was. "
"Outstanding This album is about Jermaine's life experiences and isn't afraid to get 
personal. Cole isn't as popular as other overrated rappers but he surely is 
one of my favorites. Real music. "
"Mr. Nice Watch delivers again!! J.Cole delivered in so many ways with this album. He appealed to a large 
cross section of listeners and not only that stayed true to himself. I have 
been a fan since I first heard him and if nobody else buys his albums I 
will. Everyone can relate to some song on the album these experiences are 
some we all have gone through in high school, college, etc. So if you feel 
distressed about the direction hip-hop is going this album is just what the 
Doctor ordered. Now take two tracks and call me in the morning. "
"Dope album One of the best albums, if not the best besides Cadillactica, of 2014. My 
fav song is ""Love Yourz."" "
"This might be album of the year Is refreshing to see someone rapping about something different, rap is not 
just jewelry, drugs and violence, anybody can relate to this album. I 
personally love every track, I can play it without skipping any tracks. "
Real Artist Real Music Man anyone can rap but only a few can emcee. Dat boi Cole is cold... lol 
"Fire Cole is one of those rappers that wants to connect his situations to 
others in the form of rap (not that trashy kind). His lyrics are very 
meaningful. In two decades this album will be a classical masterpiece. My 
hats of to Cole for this awesome album. "
"Must have album..great lyrics..great meaning..J Cole makes himself really 
relatable and not high and mighty..I feel his pain because I go thru the 
same things... "
"AOTY Literally every song feels different, fire squad he SNAPPED, the beats are 
what I like and man this album is on replay in my truck and crib, hell even 
the intro cool af...great job #COLEWORLD "
"Still getting into this album after being let down by drakes nothing was 
the same ,I was impressed with FHD.Some songs really sound like he's 
speaking from the heart (intro,love yourz) and songs that can get you hype 
like fire squad, no role modelz, and a tale of 2 cities. "
"I'm shocked. Yes, we will never get another tupac. But honestly, this is the closet we 
will ever get to a rapper like pac. He's so underrated. Cole world/winter 
forever. "
Southern N***A with a WICKED NYC FLOW!!!! Thank you J.Cole! I almost gave up on HIP HOP. 
"Real Hip-Hop Not that hip-POP, crap-rap that's been slowly killing the genre this last 
decade (or 2). I love this album, been playing it nonstop.. great work by 
j.cole.. "
"Killed it! J Cole coming out with this gorgeously made album, took me by surprise. 
When I first heard it I couldn't stop hearing everything cole had to offer. 
Just buy this album it's definitely worth all 9.99 and more!!! "
"Jermaine Cole 2014 forest hills drive best album of the year !!! Im sooo happy to see him getting his thing done he goes so much further 
than rap hes the best at telling storys today and this is rap plain and 
simple telling storys u can understand and relate to better than rachet 
music all the kids like now days i have always been with cole and i think 
always will be a fan hes dope too dope "
"Classic What can you say about this man he is amazing he is simply the best story 
teller ever I've listened to people who make me see this but this man helps 
me relive life and realize how precious each moment was. I have been follow 
him since 2010 so when I hear he is going to put something out 3 minutes is 
too long let alone 3 weeks but I'll chill on the jock riding I just wish 
the best for this man he is by far the very best out. I hope it sell 50 
million copies I know I'm getting 3. "
"Fire Once again, Cole has created another masterpiece. The songs do not only 
tell a story, they convey positive messages that have been lacking in 
modern day rap. All his flows work marvelously with his flows and his 
wordplay and references are top notch as always. This is a Cole world, and 
Jermaine is spitting fire. "
"J cole is the best!! S/O to J cole, the nigguh is real, we need rappers like him, hs such an 
inspirational rapper..the whole album is dope..especially ""Love yourz and 
No role models"", I learn alot than just going with the beat, you the fucken 
best, I love you @jcole I cant wait to hear whats next...#ColeWorld ..all 
tracks on repeat #HipHopKing "
"Revolutionary in Today's Music It's nice to see that some artists use real life application to their 
music. Cole ties the whole album together with a collective theme that 
reaches listeners. Forest Hills Drive really opened me up to the hip hop 
world of music. J Cole may have some sick beats in his music, but he is a 
master lyricist with a true message that is hard to argue against. If you 
are looking for an album that you can't stop listening to (like me), then 
this is the one for you. "
"Amazing Album This album is as good if not better than Born Sinner. I've played through 
the album 3x so far today. We'll worth the money. If you like J Cole, hip 
hop, lyricists or meaning in your music then grab this. #ColeWorld "
"BEST LYRICIST OF ALL TIME! Throughout the coming years J. Cole seriously surprised me as artists. Im 
expecting alot from this album, just like I did from the previous ones! 
Much respect king Cole! #ColeWorld! "
"Brilliance. True Art In Love with Music again. True ARTIST, not that Young Thug, 2 Chainz 
bullshit. His music makes you feel, it makes you think. He brought back the 
original true art form of Hip Hop "
"Best album I've heard all year This album is a breath of fresh air. Glad it's still artist that's not 
scared to go against the grain and stand out from the fads on radio. Almost 
anybody can relate to this album. "
"Fifty shades of grey Absolutely loved the books!!! The movie though, not as good as I thought 
it would be. Also love the song "" Love me like you do"" & ""Earned it"". "
"Can't listen to any song Read all the books numerous times, love it so much and the movie. The 
songs that are on there Are so amazing and went to listen and I screamed 
because I was so happy the movie came out and I can handle the songs! 
One.At. A time! Lol "
"Fifty Stars! I have read the books numerous times since its release in 2011! I have 
waited for this movie & soundtrack for as long as i did for the Twilight 
Saga lol i can personally tell where every song would appear in the book if 
i was reading it now! Get the whole soundtrack! I love The Weekend's Earned 
it (most played song on my and The Frank Sinatra remasted version of 
Witchcraft!! JUST ENJOY MK! #FSOG "
"Beyond perfect always worthy I can't even esxplain how obsessed I am over this movie, soundtrack, 
actors. When you hear the songs it takes you back to the movie. All the 
songs are so fitting, perfectly and flawlessly!!! Amazing story, can't wait 
for the next part! "
"Made me and my best friend cry :"") Wonderful song, hear it EVERY TIME my best friend and I handout :) "
"To all the haters, Please just get over it. It's an album for the movie. Not the movie 
itself. And calling Ellie Goulding ""Smelly Goulding"" seriously? So 
childish. And if BDSM isn't your thing then ignore it! Some people are into 
it some aren't, we're all different that way! Some of you are like 20 or 30 
yet you act like you're a small child or a teenager. "
"Crap!!!!! Lol, Smelly Goulding think she's all that because she is friend with 
Taylor Swift. This song is a bore just like the ""artist"" who sung it, she 
is mediocre and should not have a career. Lol by felicia *Boop* "
"Great sound track Well worth the money. Just wanted to point out some reviews don't make 
sense a couple of people have posted that they ""love the soundtrack but I 
hate the movie"" and then give the soundtrack a one star. In what universe 
does that make sense that you love the soundtrack but you're only giving it 
one star "
"LOVED IT. I only wanted one song from the album, then I heard them and the was all 
good. The one by Ellie Goulding gave me goose bumps and it goes so well 
with the movie. "
"Great soundtrack I love this soundtrack only downfall is I don't have all the songs which 
is weird. But over all its great! "
"Why I love it? Become my song ♥ it love me like you do! But...de oder song don't love 
her... "
"So good I downloaded Earned It when it came out and I have been waiting for the 
whole album ever since. Some of the songs are a little weak, but it's very 
hard to make album with all great songs. I will say that I thought it was 
disappointing that some of the songs on the album were released before the 
soundtrack. But it makes up for that with the other songs. If, you don't 
like slow songs then this album is not for you, but if you do this is 
perfect. "
"Ellie is the best!! I love ellie Goulding, she's my fave singer!! I don't understand why 
everyone hates her!! "
"Oh no What is our world coming to? If people think getting physically hurt is 
fun or thrilling, they are sick!! I would rate this a zero star if I could "
"OMG Awesome CD, please don't judge based off the snippets this is simply 
amazing.. I'm listening while reading the book again for the umpteenth time 
on a cold night in Birmingham al..can't wait to see the movie!!!!!! "
"Love it! Love this song!LOVE! It makes me feel better when I listen to it if I am 
in a bad mood and when I am in a good mood! Love listening to it while 
doing my homework! "
"S&M? Really? Bondage and all that. Hmm, getting beat up so badly you need a safe word? "
"Awesome movie! What a great movie! I hadn't completed the first book before I saw the 
movie, but instantly fell in love with the characters and the story behind 
them. The music adds to the drama too. "
"The Beyoncé Crazy In Love Remix is insane!!! Its so sexy, seductive, and 
sultry. The beat is amazing and its so moody n dark. Bey's tone is dope! 
Omg im mad its album only tho lol. I just want the 2 Beyoncé songs tbh. "
"Bad movie love song Bad movie but love the song if you plan to see it DO NOT it is nasty my 
opinion love the song love me like you do edille goulding great work love 
ya "
"The soundtrack itself is amazing.....the books and the movie not soo much I am in LOVE with the soundtrack especially ""love me like you 
do""........but i seriously DO NOT like the books or the movie at all......i 
mean being sexually abused isnt what you call a ""turn on"" i really dont 
think advertising domestic violence/abuse is a good thing since it will 
obviously influence our younger generation but i still give 5 stars to the 
soundtrack due to the music being really catchy (probably the only reason 
why the movie was a hit in the first place☺) "
"Earned It Amazing creative beautiful magical romance happiness love awesome song 
it's like I get to song for you its all about you says you're worth it I 
deserve it I'm always worth it that sound convincing me that song made me 
happy I love the song thank you for writing it.♡♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ 
♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡:* "
"AMAZING perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect 
perfect perfect perfect "
Wonderful All songs are wonderful...and I love the mix of new and old. 
"Something New Something deep with in that can only be felt with true emotion, I like the 
movie alot the soundtrack just plays the movie for me every time I play it "
"Best soundtrack I've heard in years Enjoyed the books, movie was ok...but the music is wondeful. Been a fan of 
Danny Elfman for years--he never disappoints! Love the eclectic mix of old 
favorites and new originals. Can't stop listening! "
"You HAVE to get this! I mean, come on! You read the books (maybe more than once like I did) and 
you are going to see the movie! Don't listen to the little ""blips"" of the 
songs on here like I did... That almost made me not get it! (I mean Frank 
Sinatra, what?) The songs are great! Just do it! You are going to Love It 
like I do! I've been listening all morning since I got the album and can't 
stop! I even like Frank! ;) "
"Havent seen fifty shades But I hate earned it so much. I don't have an aux in my car so I listen to 
a lot of radio and that's the only song that plays anymore. It's so slow 
and stupid. Ahhhh such a stupid song. "
"I wish the books were as good as the movie soundtrack! I'm very impressed with this soundtrack. I love every song with the 
exception of I'm On Fire.... They should have used the original version by 
Bruce Springsteen, his version is very hypnotic and sensual and would have 
fit the movie perfectly! "
"Good music Sexy. Sexy. Sexy.This is a good album. And a great movie for those of us 
who weren't expecting pornography. "
Just to be clear my 5 stars are for Ellie. I don't give a flying f about 50 shades. 
"Amazing Firstly I love them ALL and it moves me to tears you can feel the 
emotional pull and I constantly think of the movie when I hear them, scene 
and all. Also you guys are complaining about some skipping when it CLEARLY 
states you have to have the physical copy for them lol.. Read people. "
"Hate it, non hater! Fifty shades of grey is a highly detailed meaning of perverted garbage! "
"WoW, AWESOME MIX! I absolutely love this! I usally don't like EVERY song on a soundtrack, 
but this one is mixed just right. Well WORTH the money! "
"Listen to it daily! What's not to love? Every artist on the cutting edge is here. The music 
and the movie have perfect synchronicity. "
"WONT EVEN DOWNLOAD Album won't even download, hope I can work this out as the soundtrack is 
amazing. Will give more stars when play decides to work. "
"Amazing Loved the books an love the film even better and the music is really good 
goes well with the film :) "
"Horrible! This movie could have easily been turned into a thriller. The guy is a 
stalker with serious issues. She couldn't even visit her mom without him 
showing up. He would stalk and control and then spend money and wow her to 
distract her. I don't see why this has become so popular. Although the 
woman who have gone gaga over it seem to be very lonely so maybe there's a 
connection? The album is as bad as the movie. Save your money. "
"OMG Ellie Goulding is the best I love her song love me like you do OMG =D SHE 
BREAKS ME IN JOY WHEN I LISTEN TO THAT SONG :'D "
"This is truly an impeccable soundtrack!!! Each track indicates the fear, 
the tension and romance involved in Christian and Anastasia's complex 
relationship. ‘Love Me Like You Do,’ ‘Crazy In Love’ and ‘One Last Night’ 
are particularly gorgeous! :-) Worth every single penny!!! "
"BEST ALBUM SO FAR I've been a directioner for almost a year and a half. I don't know if that 
doesnt make me a real fan, since im only 13, but i honestly love the album. 
It's the best one so far, because the boys wrote literally most of the 
songs. And that.makes me happyc to be able to hear what they're into. "
"Simply amazing!! Can't even form words on how absolutely amazayn this is! 
Like seriously! These boys have got it ALL! The voices, the looks, the 
style, the personality. Literally is there anything they don't have! I 
don't think so. Love them soo much!! Another album that will be on repeat 
for hours on end! Give me a minute while I go cry! "
"NEED MONEY!!!!! Seriously need to start saving for this freaking album. Like I have 
already heard all the songs. But I need the album. I'm so broke tho. Love 
they're music and I've been here since these FOUR years, so hey I deserve 
this. Lol soooooooo proud of how far our boys have come. Love them 
soooooooo much. Forever and always. Amazayn album. U should get it "
"Best 1D Album ever. All the other albums were good, but this one is REALLY GOOD. I would have 
to say this is my favorite album. LISTEN TO STOCKHOLM SYNDROME AND WHERE DO 
BROKEN HEARTS GO AND NO CONTROL "
"One Direction They are my favorite band and I have loved them ever since they were on 
Xfactor. This is an awesome album!!! I love it, and I cry whenever I listen 
to it because it's soooo good!!!! "
"Best Album Yet I've been here from the beginning, from the bottom of the stairs. I had a 
bit of a falling out (after album #3) with the whole band and fandom 
because I found different bands that i felt a connection to instead. (Black 
Veil Brides, Of Mice & Men, Bring Me The Horizon to name a few) As soon as 
this album came out, i knew i'd love it. My favorites are #1 Once In A 
Lifetime, #2 Spaces, & #3 Clouds. "
"Amazing love all there albums this one is the best love you 1D see you 
jully 9th and 11th in sand deigo and san jose Greate amazing loveing "
"Perfect!! I just want to say a massive thank you♥thanks guys! This album's 
absolutely perfect! Fool's Gold is fantastically fantastic! You're the 
best♥remember this♥ - a Italian Fan♥ "
"1D AF! By now, If you're saying that these boy can't sing shut up, have a seat 
and listen to them sing their first albums to this. It has a completely 
different vibe, it shows that they've grown up and you can hear the 
maturity in their voices. I did a survey just for the hell of it and played 
WMYB, and other songs from UAN to 78 strangers and they all knew some of 
the songs and who it was by. When I played No Control, NIght Changes and 
Once In A Lifetime they all liked it and was surprised when I told them 
that it was 1D, they even said that they matured, and when I asked if 
they'd buy the album they said it'd be hard not to, 63 out of the 78 people 
contacted me 3 days later saying they found themselves buying the album. So 
if i could convince 63 strangers to buy an album this should prove that 
they've not only matured, but they kinda branched their listeners out to 
more than teens. (The people being surveyed was usually between that ages 
24-45) "
"AMAZING Once you hear Zayn singing in Steal My Girl, you'll already be able to 
tell that the boys worked so hard on this album. It's truly amazing that 
they're on their fourth. I love them so much and I'm so proud♥ "
"Love them♡ I've loved these boys since day one,everything they do is so inspirational 
and beatiful, I love all of there personalities (especially niall♥) and 
there music. Love them lots "
"BEST ALBUM YET! I can honestly say this is the best album yet! I've been a fan for FOUR 
years. And to see how much the boys have progressed is astonishing, the 
reason this album is the best is because its personal, every word sung 
means something to the boys! Amazing job lads much love Xx. "
"Amazing Zayn malik keep on singing, i love when you stick out your tongue your 
tattoos are a turn on and they are sexy you sound better with the music and 
with out the music your a angel that fell out of heaven one direction 
wouldnt of been a group if you wasnt in it i love you B-) :-) :-D :-P O:-) 
:-* <3 "
"Say what you want... But this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I don't usually listen 
to them but my teenage sister told me to give it a try, cause she knows 
what kind of music I like. Honestly if people didn't know this was One 
Direction and they listened to this album, they would love it! "
"Klarybel Wow 1D rocks i love what makes you beautiful and steal my girl and story 
life it's great "
"Eh I have been a fan since 2012. A dedicated true fan so before people bad 
mouth me keep that in mind. My 1D phase ended earlier this year and I think 
it had something to deal with Midnight Memories, it had some catchy songs 
but no hits! And this one although mellow, it has no potential hits (maybe 
steal my girl) it isn't the same anymore, sorry boys. I think our toll has 
come to an end. "
"FOUR It's wonderful I love it One Direction I love you guys this album is GREAT 
!! "
"Perfect Some songs in the past have been better than songs in this album but you 
can really hear how much they've grown up in this album and it's so 
beautiful that it hurts!!! Some of these vocals literally make me so happy 
I don't know what to do with myself. Can't explain in words how good this 
album is. Love the boys forever *heart* "
"Loved it I really loved it it's really amazing no kiding including you niall,harry, 
Louie ,liam and zayn I loved it "
"ONE DIRECTION IS MY IDOL See im a directioner and a drummer in my school band and when i saw harry 
give his drum sticks away to some one else my heart sunk. ψ(▼へ▼メ)～→ so this 
album gives me hope "
"One Direction Is Life I love them soooooo much. I really wish I could meet them. I like all of 
them but my favorite is Niall because I like his personality and his humor 
and especially his laugh but I love all of them equally. So ya I love u 
guys soo much and I hope I could see you soon. :) And my favorite song in 
the album four is ready to run. There album is perfect I could listen to it 
all day and their other albums 2:) "
"Per-fect First album by 1D that I loves every song! The album is purely amazing. 
Its incredible to see the boys' style change throughout the year. The style 
of music grows more abd more mature each time. For new comers who wants to 
buy this album, I guarantee you won't be disappointed! Best album yet. "
"Perfect This album is just perfect! The best they did so far so it's so hard to 
choose which one is your favorite. I really recommend 18, Fool's gold, 
Change your ticket, and Act my age. Then No control and Where do broken 
hearts go and well the whole album "
"FREAKING AWESOME I love it so much. The guys have grown up SO fast. It seems like just 
yesterday they were on the x factor. Haha I sound like a proud mother. The 
whole album is awesome. I love all the songs. They are each so beautifully 
crafted and individual in their own way. My favorites are all of them haha 
so dont make me choose. "
"Love it Makes me cry with love and joy I love you niall Louis liam harry and zayn 
your my dream "
"Awesome I found out of them from a friend! She said they were really good! So I 
have been a fan of them sense than and I believe that's in the beginning! 
There songs meant a lot for me! Haha! And even though I listen to them it 
does not mean I am a gay! It just means I like there songs! Hahahah "
"I love it so much These songs are amazing i could listen to it 24/7 and i will never get 
tired of it its seriously amazing like midnight memories take me home and 
up all night "
"GOD BLESS I got aids back in 2012 but then I listened to this album and I've been 
aids free ever since "
"I love this album so much!!!!!!!!!! I have been a directioner since day 
1!!! When ever I am sad or anything I just listen to them and I sing and 
they make me feel better!!! Theny make me so happy!! When ever my family 
says really mean things about them like they can't sing and stuff I don't 
talk to them for like weeks at a time!! I love them so much!!! "
"FOUR! ❤ Best Album! The Guys Ever surprise us, but this.. it's.. INCREDIBLE! 
AMAZING! just PERFECT! "
"amazing! its so gooood its making me cry love one direction their album just keeps 
getting better love them so much "
"This is just perfect. One of the best albums by far, I would say it's actually quite mature and 
a bit laid back. "
"Amazing! I love all the songs on the album. They just keep getting better and 
better. It's so hard to choose a favorite song from this album. Definitely 
recommend it! "
"Best Album Yet I have listened to this album nonstop since Monday... I love it so much 
that I memorized all of the words to all of the songs.... Act my age, Girl 
Almighty, Stockholm Syndrome, and No control are the best.... even thoufh 
the whole album is perfect... "
"I'm in love!! My idols are better than your idols!! Jk, but I love this album I can 
finally die ☺ ☺, I love niall , bye!.,, also if u have twitter add me at 
(unnoticedmofo) I want to follow more of you guys!! "
"1d sucks They should just stop trying, honestly. 5sos fam is better than 
directioners. The only good thing 1d did was make 5sos famous because 5sos 
is obviously better, writing their own songs and playing their own 
instruments. "
"Worse than geniside!!!!!! This album is the worst thing ive ever heard since hitler! I usually love 
music but this has just led to me self harm and go into a worldwind of 
depression and hatred! "
"Great!!! 18 is one of their best songs!!! I love it so much it relates to how I 
feel! The whole album is definitely awesome! Some of their best work. "
"I loved it BUT MM is still #1! It's amazing and I feel like people aren't liking it as much because its a 
different type of music ; a little slower beat. Up all night was very fast 
and childish just like them and the TMH was better then MM and now Four. It 
represents the four years the four albums, and the four stages of them. So 
stop complaining and some fans just need to learn that they're growing up. "
One Direction Four night changes People say that I am gay just listening to one direction 
"An awesome album like Reese W. said. Great album!! I Love his version of Cop Car and how it portrays a first 
love (and it's innocence). Although I love Keith Urban ' s version, Sam 
Hunt ' s is much more believable some how. 5 stars. "
"Loved this album!! Ex to see, take your time, and break up in a small town 
on repeat for the last few days. Love the lyrics. Can't wait for the next 
album! "
"Really Great Sam is awesome! His tunes are unique, catchy, and lyrically tremendous. 
You won't go wrong with this. "
"It's complicated I'm starting to think that the rating for songs are bull. Not about what 
other people think, you listen to it and you know you like it. How do you 
know you like it by looking at someone else's rating. Don't get me wrong I 
like this album a lot. Especially houseparty that one is my jam. "
"Overrated When he released his first 4 songs I was thinking his album would be 
great! However most of the songs have way to much pop sound to it. I 
thought this was country music? Sam hunt should just go to pop music or 
alternative. "
"Bad country, great pop music, talented artist Not a country album at all! This is just a dance music album and not very 
good at that. Has a very good voice and has written some other very good 
country songs, too bad none of these are. "
"This music is jamming hot. I wish I could meet him in person.I wish I could 
be at all of his concerts. "
"I love this I think this is awesome. Plus, to the haters, its not overrated. Its not 
pop either, do u hear and GOOD and ACOUSTIC guitar in pop music... Yup, 
didn't think so. Also, if u don't like country, y r u listening to it 
(¬_¬). I think my points taken ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) "
"Boring and I COMPLETELY HATE COUNTRY MUSIC!! Ugh I don't even know how to explain how bad this album is!! It's so 
boring I feel like falling asleep...hopefully better music comes up soon 
T_T "
"Wow... Is this really what ""country"" music is passing for? Jesus, if so, that's 
awful. I didn't know country singers used autotune. Some of his songs are 
good, but not country. Break Up In A Small Town has got to be one of the 
worst songs I've ever heard. It was TERRIBLE. I'm 21 and feel really badly 
if my generation thinks this is real music. "
"Love it Miss being loved by my husband ,we still together but he doesn't show me 
love. Very lonely for his touch. "
"In love with Sam Hunt Can't get enough of Sam Hunt! Loving everything this album has to offer 
love the vibe of it, the originality, and the amzing music. When I buy 
songs from an album I have to like the little clips I here. I ramdomly 
research top charts and up coming artist so I'll have a lot of different 
vibes on my play list and this is definitely a good change of pace! Keep up 
the hard work and I'll be a fan for life!! "
"I really love this song! I saw him live when he performed with Taylor and I 
fell in love. "
"In Love Definitely loving all of his music, especially Make You Miss Me & Take 
Your Time! Love the beats, love his voice, love it all! Not to mention he's 
a cutie ;) "
"Montevallo Sam Hunt is an excellent musician. Each song showcases different elements 
of genres that usually don't mix with one another. But Hunt does this so 
well in all ten cuts on his full length debut LP. The songwriting is top 
notch, but the production of a few cuts holds the record back at times. 
However, this doesn't ruin said cut. This record will be recommended to 
friends of mine and enjoyed by myself for a long time. Congratulations on a 
spectacular debut record Mr. Hunt! "
"Love Sam Hunt His songs are amazing and I just love his voice! A must have, the whole 
record is wonderful! "
"Great album loved every song Actually loved every song on the album. Esp. Ex to see, make u miss me, 
and leave the night on!!! "
"Sam Hunt I love the song take your time and leave the night on and cop car And 
break up in a small town. Love it Keep me updated!!! Keep singing every day 
Sam hunt "
"I love this song but I can't listen to it won't let me at all I click on 
listen an every time it says syncing your music an it stresses me so 
basicly it took my money "
"AMAZING Sam Hunt is the best country singer ever! Go see him live before knocking 
him. Seeing videos of him performing doesnt do him justice. Hes absolutely 
amazing. His stage presence the notes he hits chills. Hes gonna be a,legend "
"Like it than like it! He is a great artist I love him and pop or country it doesn't matter if 
you like it than like it! And if you hate country than don't bother even 
commenting about how it's too country or not enough if you like it you like 
which I happen to love it! "
"Awful This is the worst music I have ever heard. Break up in a small town has to 
be the worst song I have ever heard. He talks more than he sings. Not 
country music at all. "
"SAM HUNT IS AMAZING I KNOW ALL HIS SONGS IF COUNTRY MUSIC WASNT REAL I WOULD KILL MY SELF IF I COULD MEET U SAM I 
WOULD HUG U THEN I WOULD NEVER TAKE A SHOWER!!!!!! AND FAINT!!!!! OH YA U 
PEEPS THAT HATE COUNTRY MUSIC HATERS GONNA HATE "
"Awesome Only listened to it one time thru but my favorite lyric is is Make you 
miss me. 'you leave a slipknot in the strings you attach' awesome CD "
"Amazing I love Sam Hunt and this album he just totally rocked. Some amazing talent 
and the feels are just amazing! I recommend! "
"Sam is such an amazing artist! I have yet to hear a song of his that I 
don't like. "
"Small town, big star Proud to say this guy is from my hometown. Way to go sam. Amazing album. "
"I love this album ! My favorite song is break up in a small town , but 
don't get me wrong I love all of them so much ! One of my favorite albums . 
Sam is such a talented artist one of my favorite . "
"Loved it I love this album, leave the night on, house party, break up in a small 
town are deffently my faves. I would highly recommend this album. :-) "
"I love it I love love love love love love it!!!!! Whether I'm sad or in a dancing 
mood I put this on and I just get my mood back up again "
"Love love love!! Omg Sam there's not one song I don't love!! Look out looks like we have a 
new #1 artist in town! "
"Montevallo This album is amazing! Sam Hunt is such a breath of fresh air in Country 
music. Make you miss me is my all time favorite right now! "
"LOVE After I heard his first single, I searched for his other stuff. I didn't 
find anything that wasn't good. I <3 Sam Hunt! "
"Favorite artist! Sam is by far my favorite new artist! Love, love, love everything he 
records & am dying to see him live! "
"Yeah we both know Your ""girl"" will have her mouth, I'm sorry hands full for a bit, post your 
email I'd love to send you the pics "
"Love it! Love his rap talk/ country singing! Amazing album. Love the song speakers, 
take your time, housr party, and his version cop car. "
"I usually never listen country. As a matter of fact I hate country but for 
some reason I like this album. "
"Best Album EVER!! I listen to this album everyday! No joke! And I never get tired if this! I 
""discovered"" leave the night on in late September. Fell in love 
immediately! Looked for more songs, but sadly there weren't any... Kept 
listening to the song over and over. Until about December. I found out he's 
dropping an album!!! Got so excited and listened to it and fell in love all 
over again!! Rate this album 1,000,000/10 "
"Hi...loved the words...it's only but a memory now. Listen, the only 
negative was combining the lyrics and the video...the story doesn't match. 
Like: if it's about a single woman in a bar; fine. It's (the words) not 
about a married woman leaving her abusive husband! Get it??? Hope so. Best 
Wishes to you + yours!!! :) "
"Great It's cool to see how different genres influenced Sam Hunt's song writing. 
It's not just country! Great album and a great artist. Have been rocking 
this album in car/phone for months now! "
"He is the real deal A musician like this comes around once in a generation (if that) - don't 
pass him up "
"Good songs I loved ""Take me to Church"" when it first came. Untill that song came out, 
I'd never heard of Hozier. I hope he makes more songs that are just as 
great as Take me to Church. "
"I don't think anybody understands what he was trying to say in this song. 
Which is what causes the dislikes and unhappy ""fans"". Sad because this is a 
beautiful song with a meaningful video. "
"Amazing presence... Hozier has an amazing vocal talent. I could listen to him all the time, 
love his style and the power in his voice. Real talent. "
"New Fan Dark and soothing! He has a great voice and the lyrics are very 
fulfilling. Good to just sit and get lost into. "
"Positive! I am not support same sex marriage, however, I love the song ""Take me to 
church"". If you listen to it without watching MV you would feel the pain in 
the song. Perfect pain! "
"Hozier Awesome! When you can play nearly every song on it & they're ALL GREAT!! 
He is one of the best Blues artists to come around in a long time. Although 
his Unmistakable Style Is most Definitely his Own!! If he continues on his 
present path technically, artistically & lyrically~ Such enthusiasm & ever 
so humble....., Quite possibly could be up there with Vaughn, King & 
Coltrane. Lyrically he's phenomenal. Bravo!! ;-) "
"Hozier Take Me to Church This whole album is gut wrenching goodness! The style and lyrics make me 
want to scream MORE NOW PLEASE! I love the wordplay, always. Been awhile 
since I found an album I enjoyed this much. Thanks, Hozier! "
"Awsome I love him his song's are great when his song came out ''TAKE ME TO 
CHURCH'' I never knew him before his own album came out like I said I love 
him I love him "
"Take Me To Church Didn't know I could cry so hard from this song, it is really beautiful, 
but it is so sad. "
"Great album; what a soothing yet powerful voice! A bit of Soul, Gospel and Blues. The end of each song desires you wanting 
more. A refreshing and addictive sound. His music reminds me of why I love 
Ben Harper's music...it's deep, personal and spiritual. Would love to see 
them together in concert! "
"Take me to church A truly deep, chilling and beautiful song. However, the interpretation of 
it for most people is very wrong. It is a metaphor comparing a relationship 
between a boy and girl to religion. Hozier also talked about the song and 
its relation to the catholic church and its view on homosexuality and its 
political and social cowardice. I am a Christian, albeit shaky on the 
subject of homosexuality and love, find its message negates the fact that 
its a song about heartbreak between a man and woman. However, that doesn't 
change my opinion as this being one of the greatest soul songs ever. "
"Best Album Heard In My Life This is probably the best album front to back I may have ever heard in my 
lifetime! I usually never buy albums but the quality of song writing and 
holders amazing soulful voice makes this album absolutely one of the best. 
Truly the best album I have ever heard! "
"Hozier has just got the most amazing and melodic voice. He's extremely 
talented with his words and music and it makes each song beautiful in it's 
own unique way. Something that is really rare is that he's as good live as 
he is on record. He's a very soulful artist and extremely talented. "
"Unique style, captivating voice I love this album. I love every song...except ""in a week."" That song is 
just creepy. Love Jackie and Wilson. Love From Eden. Great voice. I'd love 
for Hozier to be known for more than take me to church. It's a beautiful 
song but he's so much more than that "
"Take me to church love! ♥ I love songs they are smooth and graceful I only like slow and grateful 
songs they are awesome I love take me to church but the one thing I really 
want is um I forgot that song but I really love it. It had the word I 
forgot sorry but I love your songs! But plz make them free plz reply back 
its really grateful-kardia (I am a female) "
"All the Songs Glorious. There is always this sense of peace that washes over me when I 
hear his voice... It's like all the tension comes rolling off my shoulders 
and I can relax. But at the same time I can really concentrate. His music 
is so emotional and breathtaking and inspiring, it's perfect for an artist 
like me to draw some imagination from instantly. Love it. And Love him. "
"Great A well written song, catchy beat but not annoying "
"Hozier Hauntingly spine tingly warm cuddles by the fire awesomeness. Thought 
provoking, and smile persuading genius, thanks Hozier :) "
"Being gay is wrong so if your gay god is there pray and ask him for a new 
start gay plpe might be in love but what's the use being in love if its not 
the love gods wants you to av the devil is who gives plpe the way to love a 
gay person so repent pray for go to forgive you and repent I'm a guy and I 
believe that God loves us all so y not love God like he loves you?? How do 
u we love God..?? Well we do what is right and what God wants us to do so 
please stop being gay and love God !!!! "
"Best singer ever! Hozier has such a great voice, I am glad he is using it well to create 
songs that I enjoy, and I'm sure plenty of people enjoy, a lot "
"Love this album!!! Definitely influenced by Elton John, and that's a good thing! I can feel 
what he feels in the song, not far away from the visual lyrics of Bernie 
Taupin. The Buzz at 96.5 has made this song a hit in Kansas City and I hope 
Hozier's fame is spreading all over like it was welcomed here cuz he needs 
to be heard. "
"New fan! I have only heard their hit song before today, and decided to take a 
listen to the rest of their songs. I'm glad I did! I absolutely love their 
sound! "
"Superb What a powerful voice this fellas got. Love this track even copy and 
pasted the lyrics so I can sing along. Will certainly be purchasing the 
rest of his album. Quality stuff. "
"Absolutely Beautiful I discovered Hozier like most people did,""Take me to Church"",and the first 
time I heard it I got chills all over my body.The song moved me and it 
affected me to my core. I got it, maybe not in the way it was intended,I 
had my own interpretation. I saw my own pain and loss. All his music is 
breathtaking. This man is baring his soul in his music and sharing it's 
beauty with the world. Instead of acting crazy and preaching him as the 
devil, we should be grateful to be a part of it. "
"ACE! One of those albums you need to own in your lifetime, regardless of the 
type of music you own. This guy's voice and pure artistry will bust through 
your door, tear down your walls and latch onto your heart like a 
parasite.... For a ripe 25 year old, Hozier is one of the most refined, 
sophisticated and competent musician I have ever heard! Don't even get me 
started on his live concerts, that's a whole other level!!!! Ace!!! "
"Even better live! I saw him in September here in Nashville and will be seeing him again in 
March! So amazing :) "
"Hooked on Hozier This album is fantastic! I could listen to Take Me To Church on repeat all 
day, and the rest of the album does not disappoint. "
Amazing voice Great album and an amazing voice. Powerful lyrics! 
"Good feeling when it hits your ears This album is so daggon good. Very diverse set of songs and his voice is 
amazing. I love it. "
Its like crack you just can't stop lol Best song ever 
"Lyrical poetry There is something about the way the words flow in his songs. Perhaps 
because they pertain to deeper matters of humanity. His messages are woven 
within his music. "
"Hozier Wow, outta nowhere this album arrived and I love it. Great tunes, great 
voice, great! "
Hozier Outstanding; truly inspiring and at the same time soothing and comforting! 
"High quality album The whole album is full of just masterpieces. Even from the beginning of a 
song to the end. I recommend listening to this album on a nice pair of 
speakers or headphones because it really has some nice sounds blended into 
the songs you just can't hear on a cheap setup. "
Great singer song writer He's a refreshing and awesome artist. Love this album 
"Worst Take me to church is literally the worst song I've ever heard in my life. 
I don't care about the lyrics. The melody is so annoyingly dark and is not 
pleasant to listen to. "
"Hauntingly beautiful Smooth, sexy and powerful. A must have. "
"Awesome love it. This album has such great songs especially 'take me to church'. I can't 
stop listening to this song. It's so awesomeness. "
"Love This Album Take me Church was what I was going to purchase, but after previewing the 
other songs bought the album. "
"XO TIILL I OVERDOSE Myyy babyyyy .. Hes amazingg being listenning to him even before he hit 
the charts !! Never failed me "
"Much much better than Kiss Land, 1st 5 songs are amazing, that sample on 
Tell Your Friends was used before him by GZA/Genius from Wu-Tang Clan on 
his solo album Pro Tools but Weeknd killed it, from the 1st time i heard 
that song i new Kanye West produced it, cos only Kanye can put those lyrics 
with that sample and make an epic song , i hope he releases a new album 
this year this not time for resting, he's gotta work 24/7 , like Pac did , 
just record and put out albums, he can rest in his 40's, by then he ll be 
bigger than MJ ... "
"Yessss Abel I wish I would've found out about The Weeknd sooner...oh well, his music 
is my life now <3 "
"Amazing, as always I can't tell you how much I love Abel's songs. He is such a talented 
artist and I'm proud of him getting this far. XO "
"Terrible How can he grow up listening to the best music ever made and be a part of 
making the worst music I've ever heard? "
"Beauty Behind The Madness One of the best LPs I've heard n a long time! The music world needed this. 
To me it sounds like a mix between R.Kelly n Drake. Excellent Music. Listen 
to this "
"Blown away! Not many albums out there I can say I would listen start to finish. This 
is definitely one of those albums I can hit play and just listen for hours! "
"Old Fan.. I've been a fan since his first release, I will say that I miss his old 
style but after listening to this album on repeat this evolved style is 
actually amazing. He still has a lot of songs that have his old style, one 
thing I'm not a fan of is all these random features, I mean ed sheeren? 
Labyrinth? Only good feature is lana del rey which is a collaboration 
that's overdue. "
"XOTWOD I've been XO since 2011 hes grown a lot it went from nobody in my school 
knowing who Abel was a now we poppin now everybody wanna be XO its levels 
to it XO fam got traditions /THE NOISE/HOB,EOS,THURS/KISSLAND/ and now 
BEAUTY BEHIND THE MADNESS "
"The weekend, he's got his own special kind of voice.. Cant feel my face "
"Perfect Blend of The Weeknd I don't usually write reviews, but I started listening to The Weeknd 2-3 
ago it has been a pleasure to listen to his music and how he's growing as 
an artist. The songs have a high replay value which I love most, Tell Your 
Friends and Prisoner come to mind. Great album and worth the purchase. "
"Real experience What he talks about hits home for a lot of us out here.... that is if you 
bout that life. "
This is absolutely my favorite album! Since it was released I've listened to it ever day. 
"Amazing I can't believe how amazing this album is. Granted there is one song I do 
not like, but everything else is a master piece. I love the different vibes 
as the album caters to all music lovers. "
"There is NO song I don't LOVE, this album and the last one have been on 
repeat sine the 28th. Every song is relatable to different situations in 
life, and the sound overall is amazing, I find myself really enjoying every 
beat. Songs I love the most are Shameless, Angel and Acquainted. "
"God of voice like himself He's more than human, the words of his breath consume me. Everything he 
says is real. Angel was definitely show him off on me. Your biggest fan "
"Chapter 3 Been following Abel since day 1. His sound has definitely changed, but i 
continue to love his music! My top track faves are Aquainted, Shameless, 
Dark Times & Prisoner. Oh and kudos to all collaborations on this album! 
They all sounded heavenly ❤ "
"INLOVE WITH THE WEEKND I've been listening to the weeknd for about almost 3 years now....When I 
first listened to one of his songs immediately it hit me. The lyrics to 
Rolling Stone were just perfect...And that's when I started downloading 
more songs to my phone and ever since then his music and I clicked I fell 
inlove with his music as well as his hair lol. I love him so much one of 
the best artists I have ever listened too. "
"Abel is a vocal god I've been apart of XO since 2011 I was twelve and fell in love with him 
and his voice. I'm glad for his success but I hate the fake fans that claim 
they're a fan but don't know anything besides his more mainstream songs. 
Real life and shameless are the best songs on here. Abel I love you. You 
are my king. "
"A Little Dissapointing This is no one near as amazing as Trilogy. Now this isn't a bad album yet 
it's also not an amazing album. I was really let down by this, only a few 
of the songs really had a deeper meaning, most of the songs were just about 
sex and drugs which I'm fine with sometimes. J Cole does it perfectly , the 
weekend, not so much. Can't feel my face could've been way better yet I 
hope he doesn't continue putting out music for 15 year olds, I want some 
really deep and emotional music, that's what I love about Abel. "
