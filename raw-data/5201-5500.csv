listened to it on repeat. What else can I say. A diff buy "
"Excellent I have always been a John Legend fan, so I was extremely excited when this 
album was released. I love all of me, it's the theme song for my husband 
and I. This by far his BEST album in my opinion! It was worth every penny! 
I absolutely love it! "
"Mr. John Legend I don't rate albums or use the word im about to use for most music, but 
this album truly a Masterpiece a must get. "

"Hell yeah Luke! I've purchased this CD quite a while ago, and just came to giving a rating 
now. Luke's third album is great, he's done it again. No filler tracks 
although one or two of them are a bit forgettable (they're still good). 
Can't wait for Dirt Road Diaries!!. "
"Awesome CD, Every song is great! Very rarely do you find a CD that has so many great songs. If you are 
lucky, at best, half of them end up being good. That is NOT the case with 
this album. Every song on here is great! Money well spent! Most of my 
favorites on this album were not released on the radio. If you don't 
already own this album, what are you waiting for? "
"Best Album I've Ever Gotten My Hands On Its a amazing album for sure. Luke did a heck of a job. For those of you 
having errors listening/downloading if you can go buy the album in a store 
put it on your computer & plug your phone up to the computer & transfer it 
from there. :) "
"Awsome Good job Luke stay alive!!✴;-) and none of his songs are bad;-) are u a 
wizard Luke making sure self a awesome butiful singer......... I mean um 
smooth singer! Yup that's what I men well that was imberising did I spell 
it right no but u know what I mean! "
"My my. Country music has truly fallen from grace. What happened? We went from 
Waylon, Willie, and Merle, to this over produced, shiny, fake, meaningless 
tripe. The music is uninspiring, the songwriting is well, let's face it, 
it's as bad as it can get really. "
"Luke Bryan This album is amazing. I know every single word to every single song. Its 
official, me and Thomas Luther Bryan will get married. Ugh, I have an 
obsession. I love you Luke! "
"Luke Bryan Amazin music. You can actually hear what people are sayin. Other than 
stupid m and m and other dumbies. :-) "
"Luke Bryan <3 HE HAAWTT ;) oh my gee. i love luke bryan, hes just one of the sexiest things just 
about ever. well right behind channing taytum <3 mmm(: love him.(: 
-shalana_fay. :) <3 "
"1 good song There is only one goof song and it's the 1st song he lost my business when 
he put God's name is vain in his song! "
"Best singer ever How in the world did this cd and the crash my party album not receive 
album of the year really like 8 singles between the two at least "
"I love me some Luke Bryan!!! That man drives me wild and gets me all worked up. And that little Easton 
Corbin does me the same way!!! They are so sexy and gorgeous. "
"So hot I love u luke brian!!!!lol♥♡♥lol;):):D:P You r so hot and the a same thing with your music!!!! Aaaaahhhhhhh (if you 
were here im screaming!!)♥♡lol;):):D=):Po.s. I go to every 
concert!!:);)=):D:P♥♡lol "
"Ahhhhhhhh! He leaves me speechless. Every single song connects to Me in someway. All 
time favorite plus Jason Aldean. Best concert of my life. "
Ohh I know O.o l can't. Get enough of drunk on YOU!!! 
Drunk on you Omg this is my life ever since I was little. 
"Such a bad country musician His music is extremely shallow and completely directed towards hormone 
crazed woman. Pathetic. "
"Tailgates and Tanlines Definitely Luke's best album. I've heard these songs hundreds of times and 
they never get old! "
"COUNTRY BOY, SHAKE IT FOR ME BOY ;) this man couldn't be more beautiful.. he's amazing! "
"Tailgates and Tanlines I enjoyed a number of songs on this album, but there were a few that just 
weren't my cup of tea. I had to give him 5 stars because I love the way he 
puts the words, and the music, and the emotions together to make his songs. 
Thank you. "
Drunk on you Best song ever!! 
"He is the best! You think different you come and talk to me because you'll get your butt 
kicked "
"Love this but 1 song wont play Bought it bc i love several songs on this album but drunk on you wont play 
:( & thats my super fave! "
"Awesome Country Thank you Luke! You are a voice I would listen to all day singing. Well I 
do...hahahaha. Great Album...two thumbs up, Cowboy. "
Drunk on you Love it so so much! Its always stuck in my head! :) 
"My favorite Im little drunk on you high on summer time is my luke bryan tattoo. He is 
my favorite country artist of all "
"$2.99 ""catch"" Just grabbed this album for $2.99. As far as I can tell the ""catch"" is 
they want you to play it through google music. However, you can download 
the MP3s twice. So that's what I am doing now. Then I can put it on a CD to 
play elsewhere. "
Drunk on you The ultimate tailgate backwoods lovesong!! 
"BEST ALBUM EVER!!!!! :D I LOVE THIS ALBUM!(: Every song is so good!(: I have never not liked one 
of his songs!!!!(: If i could give this 10 stars i would! :D LOVE you 
Luke!!!!! <3333333333333 I'm your biggest fan! !!! :D <3 cant wait to c you 
in concert! :D "
"Luke Bryan Love his music. U can understand the words and the meaning of the songs... 
Caroline, I'm so jealous of you... Your husband is hot!!!! And sexy!!!! 
Love his voice... "
"absolutley perfect You can relate to every song on the album and they are all flawless songs 
to listen to on those friend filled summer nights. we can never forget how 
hot he is either ! he's irresistible !!❤❤❤ "
Amazing I just LOVE Luke Bryant! I want him to sing to me personally so bad 
"I Don't Want This Night To End & Drunk On You Waiting for that sweet country girl to steal my heart so i can play & sing 
her these 2 songs. "
"P E R F E C T I O N (; I love luke bryan his music is amazing I've seen him in concert 2 times 
and again this july 13! Btw he's AMAZING LIVE ♥ "
Drunk on u You rock 
"Luke Bryant!! He's never failed in making a great album! His voice is perfection, I will 
always be a fan! I was never a fan of country but after listing to him, 
country is all I listen to! If you like Luke I recommend you try Jason 
Aldean, or Blake Shelton as well!(: "
"Country Luke Bryan is an amazing artist. He's about as country as country gets. He 
grew up on a farm (a peanut farm is still a farm) and has an amazing accent 
so don't say he's not country "
Drunk on you You have the best music than anyone else 
I dont want this song to end THIS IS THE BEST SONG EVER 
"1d lover I love his song drunk on you reminds me of summer 0 12 I love country 
music;-) "
Awesome What more do I need to say! 
Awsome Deadly 
Credence Best song's 
"Queen Mary u never disappoint...dont worry about the bad reviews. .they 
dont know u are a Chosen one...the REAL fans support u in every way..keep 
making medicine for our souls. Thank u for letting us know its ok to step 
out of our comfort Zone to get the Blessings God have in store for us... "
"Not Mary J!! This is not Mary J. Blige! She went to London for inspiration and seems 
she spent too much time around Bono, Sam Smith and the Beatles. This is 
what it sounds like. Sorry Mary I love you but I'll pass on buying this 
album; no shade. Highly disappointed. A loyal fan. "
"Mary is back and I'm loving it. This album is fantastic. It's her best album that truely recognizes her 
talent.This album is fantastic. It's her best album that truly recognizes 
her talent. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE WOULD GIVE THIS A 1 STAR RATING, 
it deserves a 5. If artists always stay the same, nothing would set them 
apart and MARY explored new ways to bring us that awesome soul and R&B. I 
loved every song on this album and think she delivered what all the Mary 
fans needed after so long. She has outlasted so many other artists and I 
would put her as the number one artist right now. Her music is more genuine 
than all the pop/R&B that puts out all these songs that sound the same. She 
broke through barriers with this album and I am proud of her and I feel her 
struggles. Haters can aboutface on that! "
"The Best in the Business Honestly, when I looked at the ratings, I wondered how some people could 
not give her 5 stars. Her music has been in my ears since ""What's the 
411?"", and I don't plan to stop anytime soon. I love you Mary! "
"Enjoying a different sound Some folks have disliked this saying this isn't the Mary they're used to. 
An artist can't call themselves an artist if they are doing the same thing 
all of the time. Thank you Mary for exploring new facets of your artistry. "
"The QUEEN Not many can stay relevant over all these years. That's why she is queen; 
keeps reinventing herself, growing, and sounding beautifully soulful at the 
same time. LOVE her! "
"Beautiful Compilation Mary was the first artist that really grabbed my attention back with "" 
What's the 411"". Some of her albums didn't keep my attention since then.. 
But, this one does!!! It is classic Mary....love it! "
"Mary J Blige -The London Sessions Mary never fails to dissapoint. Her music is always top notch and delivers 
a message to all generations and all genres. I love it, true Mary fan. 
Thank you for always keeping the music current and fresh. "
"Loving this entire album I have always been a Mary fan but the only album that I have rocked front 
to back like this one was Share My World. She bears her soul in these songs 
and the lyrics are a reflection of her artistry. Loving this album!!!! "
"Therapy for me! I was sampling tryin to figure out if I wanted to buy K.Michelle, Nicki 
and came across my girl Mary! No braineer just what I need to speak to my 
current situation. Thank you sistah girl from the heart on one accord I'll 
always follow you! "
"Unpredictable Mary J. Was so remarkable w/her approach to this album. Thinking outside 
of ""her"" box..her comfort zone & working w/new writers & performers has 
brought a refreshing new album. Therapy is a bluesy/R&B w/a modern 
approach. Love the song. "
"Can't Knock This Hustle? I've loved Mary since her proper first appearance ""I'll Do For U"" by 
Father MC, but this is too calculated -- awkwardly trying to re-invent her 
sound. Soul is a feeling ... not a tool. "
"Loved her past work Loved her past work plus I love the way she sings because you can feel the 
story she is telling, but I'm really not loving this album... Sad "
"She is such a strong positive Black woman. She speak from her life's 
experiences and her HEART and it just like she has lived the things I been 
through in my lifetime...I LOVE YOU MARY..YOUR ARE AWESOME !.....SPEAK MY 
SISTER...SPEAK!...I WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT HERE...CHEERING YOU ON!.....YOU 
FAN SINCE ""Real Love "" Girl !..YOU ARE THE QUEEN....SEEN YOUR SHOW...WHEN 
YOU SHUTDOWN THE ESSENCE FESTIVAL 2011...YES I WITNESSED THAT 
BABY...FABULOUS!!.....,,,,,,,,.FABULOUS!! "
"Never ceases to amaze me! I've loved Mary since I was 7 years old! She's been with me every step of 
the way on this roller coaster called my life. Her songs are deep and 
relatable, inspirational and heart-felt. This album just proves, yet again, 
how amazingly awesome this woman is! "
"Simply MJB I really like this CD.. While there were a few songs I might have done 
without, it still does not change the way I feel or rate this album! Still 
talented and gifted with a voice that moves heart strings! "
"Fell off She just sounds like she didnt care how the ablum went i only like 3 
songs, not the soulful person she is "
"Love this album Right now is my favourite song at present. Grew up with Mary happy to see 
she has not lost her touch "
"Loved Loved Loved New Style but still the same Mary i fell in love with many years ago. 
..Thank you once again and forever for bringing joy through your annointed 
gift. "
"Jville observation I think Mary J. is very talented and beautiful; however this project seems 
sort of dark. There are some cuts which are nice but as a whole my rating 
would be 3.5. I think Mary can do much better and I look forward to her 
next CD. So shake it off and start over again we love the gift in you! "
"Love u Been a fan sent high school. ..I'm 34 now and not going no where. ..keep 
doing ur thing Mary "
"Instant classic I know this expression is over used but ""this is a must have"" "
"Rude People talking bad about this album got problems because this is her best 
album yet so yall haters RUDE "
"All hail the Queen Mary J Blige I been a fan since Whats the 411 album and I must said I love this new 
album Thank you for bring new music real grown folks music!!! "
"Disappointed I haven't enjoyed a whole album of hers since the second or third. With 
all these great producers....i hoped for a better one. Maybe next time? "
"Mary never dissappoints This is 1 of her best albums to date, I've been a Mary fan from day 1 and 
will continue to support her through out her career. "
"Cant wait for London Sessions!!! I don't even have to hear it. If Mary J. Blige on it, I'm buying it 
because I know it's a hit. "
"I love her music, she's helped me through my struggles. She's a phenomenal 
woman, my God Bless her.. "

"I like this album. Whole D year was one of my favorite. It's different from 
the 'my life 2 ' which is my favorite but she is showing that she can make 
more than just hip-hop and songs with hot beats. Her music has always been 
a part of my life and look forward to her next album "
"The London Lessons This album is heartfelt. I get chills and my groove every time I listen to 
it. It's a reminder to never give up on love. "
"This cd is so hot It makes you feel like mary is in a peaceful place in her life and you can 
just feel it she doesnt have to try to convince through her 
music...excellent album by a great lady who's been to hell and back and 
still on top! "
"The London Sessions Sometimes change is good. Different sound, but still MJB. Definitely a 5 
star album! This is some of her best work yet. Shows MJB's versatility. 
Working with Disclosure, Naughty Boy & Sam Smith was smart. The UK has 
always produced great music. Keep up the outstanding work. "
"Mary J Blige can do no wrong musically Mary J Blige is one of the few brilliant artists in the industry today, 
whose album is pure perfection the whole way through. This album is a treat 
to your ears and is a delight to the spirit. Bravo Mary and thank you for 
sharing your gift with us! "
Mary J Blige: The London Sessions Mary stepped outside the box on this one. I love love love it! 
"Buying it & you should too!!!! Haven't bought the album yet but listening to the sample songs are 
prefect! Haven't heard am album with all good songs till the end in a 
while. "
"Best Since ""411"" This is a straight banger (my definition for an album that contains hits 
from the beginning to the end without skipping any tracks). I have not felt 
this way since her debut album! Great job, Mary! "
"London Sessions-5 stars I'm a die hard Mary fan, this body if work is simply amazing! "
"The London Sessions I think she reinvented herself and switched it up a little. Never the less 
she still sounds good "
This album has brought me through so many times. Love it 
"Astonishing. Yesterday I bought the physical copy from best buy. The case and art work 
itself is beautiful, not to mention that the music is also stunning. It's a 
very mature album and a very wise follow up from Ultraviolence. I wouldn't 
give any advice to improve the album, other than maybe putting all of the 
lyrics, from every track, inside the booklet. My favorite songs are 
definitely Honeymoon, and Freak. Well done Lana you have slayed me again (: "
"Bittersweet Honeymoon Full of romanticism and quite atmospheric. Moody with plenty of 
interesting string instrumentation. Later tracks are more trap and hip hop 
driven, but the stark contrast adds to the overall color, which is blue. 
Blue is a recurring theme throughout the entire track list. This album 
takes steps away from Ultraviolence in that instead of building a narrative 
around dark, bleak, bombastic, indie rock instrumentals each track swells 
and floats dreamily on the sweeping strings, and luxurious sounding trills. "
"Honeymoon' may just be Lana Del Rey's best album (so far). It's got a 
noir-ish mixed with jazz mixed with pop kind of sound to it, and it's 
magnificent! This album may not appeal to those who were drawn in by the 
commercial sound of Lana's debut album, 'Born to Die,"" and that's not 
necessarily a bad thing, because Lana has created a piece of art with this 
album. Lana Del Rey isn't just some ordinary pop star, and that's what 
makes her brilliant. She's deviated from the commercial sound that was 
wanted of "
"AN AMAZING ALBUM This album slays! Lana has her own beautiful specific genre of music, and 
Honeymoon is no exception. Very romantic sounding, with blues, jazz and 
futuristic sounds intertwined. Seriously the queen of alt Her collab with 
The Weeknd is also fricking wicked!!! "
"AMAZING OMG lana never fails to amaze me. Her voice just radiates a 60's vibe and I 
love it. Its so unique and I know she'll continue to make amazing music. 
Honestly Lana could spit on me and I'd be like ""YASS LANA SLAY ME"" "
"Stunning Lana Del Rey is a very special artist, she has put so much thought and 
emotion into her songs. Each song gets better and better, then you reach 
the end of the album in pure awe. Great job yet again! "
"Amazing album! I brought this album the day it came out. This womans song lyrics in this 
whole album is just amazing! Her voice singing the lyrics accompanying with 
the beats is definitely out of this world! Once again LDR did it again. 
Great music and worth every cent you pay for it. Always and will be a huge 
fan of her and her music. "
"She's not the same When Lana first started making music, it was true and great. Now, she's 
making more music that is what people want to hear instead of her original 
type. It doesn't really even sound the same anymore. I'm disappointed with 
this album, and most people who have listened to her since the beginning 
agree that she is just not as good anymore. "
"Lana is back I have to admit I was really disappointed with her last album 
Ultraviolence. I was hesitant to buy this album because of that. I think 
anyone who is a fan will not regret getting this. I can't stop listening to 
Salvatore!! "
"The worst of the best Not a genere artist, but a class on its own. This is what the greatest 
have in common. For me, not as good as her previous albums, but one of the 
most important of the year. I bought the CD. "
"Repetitive I ADORED Ultraviolence. I was hoping to love this as well, but was not 
really impressed on the whole with this album. I gave it another listen. 
And another. And I could not ignore the fact that there were multiple songs 
which I was done listening to before they ended. There are a few good 
tracks, but Honeymoon is not as listenable as an album as Lana's other 
work. It gets too repetitive for my taste. Worth a buy if it goes on sale, 
but I bought it full price because I was so excited for more Lana. "
"I haven't heard the majority of these, besides Music To Watch Boys To, High 
By The Beach, Terrance loves you, and of course Honeymoon. These released 
are amazing, the one thing I didn't like was the slowness of Honeymoon. I 
have pre ordered the album and will revise this when it comes in. "
"Lana continues to croon Her voice is even better than on ultraviolence, and she's less sad as 
well. With more beats to back up her caramel smooth lyrics, Lana hit a home 
run. "
"I have been in love with Lana ever since before Born to Die came out and 
have been with her ever since! I honestly cannot get enough of her music, 
and nobody comes close to the way she sings and expresses the way she feels 
through music. I really know I'm going to love this album just form the 
sampler and songs' she has already released. "
"Typical Lana Del Rey Music to watch boys to, 24, Honeymoon, & God Knows I Tried are my 
favorites besides the obvious High By The Beach. Like em. I know this is 
her style but i just wish Lana would put out something a little more upbeat 
for a change. "
"Amazing so far Terrence Loves You and Honeymoon are amazing songs with eloquent lyrics 
and mesmerizing sounds. High By The Beach has more of a trap beat and 
although the song does talk about...well, getting high by the beach, the 
meaning of the lyrics is also pretty valid so don't let the title/chorus 
deceive you. The entire album is excellent so far but my favorite song, as 
of the 3 we can hear right now, is Terrence Loves You and I can't wait to 
hear the rest! "
"Perfection I've been here since 2012 for Born To Die and also in 2014 for 
Ultraviolence and now in 2015 for Honeymoon. As I even write this I'm 
listening to Terrence Loves You, and the honeymoon hotline is such an 
intelligent and loving thing "
"Masterpiece! I think this is the best album I've herd in years!! It's so complex and 
sophisticated just a mature album I'm inlove with it, it brought tears to 
my eyes. It's everything I ever wanted in a album!! Keep it up. "
"Lana has done it again I am a HUGE Lana Del Rey fan.And as much as I loved Ultraviolence, I 
really wanted something like Born To Die. And while this is like Born to 
Die,it isn't like anything else she's ever done. And it is AMAZING! This 
album is so freaking good I can't even express how in love I am with this. 
WAAY better than Ultraviolence "
"QUEEN I aLREADY KNOW THIS ALBUM IS GONNA SLAY MY EXISTENCE! IM GONNA BE 
#SNATCHED BEFORE IT EVEN COMES OUT "
"The day has finally come... I've been waiting so long for this release. Lana never disappoints. Every 
album is different from the other, yet all of them are perfect reflections 
of her artistry. She's an incredibly complex, versatile artist. This album 
is one of her best! "
"Omg I didn't know she still made music! I love her music so much, my favorite is High by the Beach. #I love Lana 
del Ray! "
"The last thing I would consider myself to be is a critic. THIS is 
singlehandedly the most incredible album I have ever heard in my life. I am 
not kidding. This album pumps life into my veins. ""Every beat of my cocaine 
heart"" "
"My bae!! Omg heard her sampler vid that she uploaded on YouTube and already love 
all the songs that were previewed in it!!! Ughhh so flippin amazing that 
I'm crying. "
"Miss Del Rey has done it again! Honeymoon is a masterpiece. Classic Lana shines through in tracks like 
""Art Deco"" and ""High by the Beach"" and her brilliant Noir Style of ""The 
Blackest Day"" ""God Knows I Tried"" and ""Music to Watch Boys To"" take you 
away to another time and place, perhaps 1940's L.A. Immerse yourself in her 
music, allow yourself to get lost, and enjoy the ride! "
"Better than radio hits When artist make music for the soul and not for hits on the radio you 
learn to apreciate who they are bc they make music from their soul and not 
just to make a catchy tune for more polularity been a fan since she was 
lizzy grant and now she's out doing herself LOVE YOU LANA you will always 
be something more than a typical singer . This album includes many songs 
that will make you rethink life and the pole who we love plz listen to her 
give her a chance "
"Amazing and beautiful album!!! Once again Lana Del Rey just took me to another world,I mean I love her 
voice and her lyrics,this is a very sophisticated and mature album you can 
hear her emotions and is just real,my favorite songs are Music to watch 
boys to religion,high by the beach, freak ,God knows I tried,I will always 
loved her talent and music!!!! "
"You're on the brink of Success Lana, I hope HONEYMOON will be a very successful album, and that you will 
be rewarded. You are a good artist and my sister who loves your work so 
dearly will always pray for the best of you. Always be proud of your music 
no matter what. May God bless you abundantly. Best Wishes. "
"Wow still strong dark and lovely Each track is like a Bond song spiced with the old westerns and lyrics 
that simply gets away with murder. More matured though but still dark and 
lovely as ever "
"Lana Deserves the World This album is going to be so beautiful and I think true fans know the 
artistry going into it. Lana is a legend and deserves so much more 
recognition than what she recieves. She definitely deserves a Grammy at the 
least. "
"The best there is. This album is the best album of the year, it has so much emotion and 
Lana's voice just captures your heart. This is my best and favourite 
purchase so far. Great singer, with a great voice and great album ☺❤☝ Love 
Lana Del Rey. "
"Best future album of 2015 Always been a fan of Lana since 2008 and her New Upcoming album Honeymoon 
i feel is going to be a success!! With her single Honeymoon, Terrence Loves 
You, and High By The Beach I can already tell what a beautiful record this 
will be!! Love you Lana Del Rey ♡♡ "
Slayed my freaking life I Love This Album Mom Is The Besttt Theres No Doubt Of That 
"Brilliant. Heartfelt and lyrical - Lana Del Rey has bitten back with a 
beautiful new album; 'Honeymoon' is the best yet. "
"The best of lana every album she treats the better she is I love lana she's 
the only singer that has gave me butterflies and keeps me tuned in all her 
songs From kill kill to Honeymoon This album is so amazing and I can't wait 
for her to sing these songs live. "
"Awesome To be honest i love every single song on this album .. just pure gold.... 
my 3 favs are High By The Beach, Religion and Salvatore but i love all the 
songs "
"Lana Del Rey Honeymoon CD The album was beautiful. Worth buying. This shows off more of Lana's 
softer voice. Every song was good I liked freak, high by the beach, 
Blackest Day, Art deco, and Terrance loves you. "
"Amazing Queen Lana always snatches my weave so it's no surprise but a beautiful album 
jazzy soft high by the beach is cool and more louder than the rest it's a 
gorgeous album Terrance loves you is my fav I'm with my mommy Lana "
"This is an excellent album. Hopefully I can see her perform these songs in 
concert like I saw her perform from pervious records this past summer. Ciao 
Amore❤ "
"A great comeback!! Lots of great songs with various tones. My favorites are high by the 
beach, art deco, religion, Freak, and music to watch boys to. "
"I love to do the interpretation of her voice!!! I can sing all of her amazing songs since I'm 6. I can even get the high 
notes and everything and now I'm 11 years old yesterday I was in a singing 
contest and I got the 2nd place just because a stupid girl sang a very high 
note song...ARGH!!! Luv katy perry and if you like to sing then keep on 
going until you get discovered and put lots of videos on youtube just so 
you can be famous and i will try it too when i buy a new camera!!! ;-) "
"Stfu... Thank You<3 If u don't like this music don't comment, unless there is a technical 
problem. Everyone has heard Katy Perry's music one time in their life and u 
know what type of music she is a part of. I love most of her songs but I 
can also enjoy skrillex and iron maiden... but hey, that's just me :) "
"Great value for money. This album is really awesome, it's got all the songs from when Katy was at 
her most popular. Tommy Sunshine's Mix of all the songs is great and I'm 
glad Kanye's back. Only thing is that the Google Play price is almost £5 
more than I paid for a physical copy. "
"Meh This album is great if you like bubblegum pop music. Part Of Me sounds 
like her other song ""The One That Got Away.' Wide Awake is probably the 
only new track that really focuses on her vocals which most of the time are 
drowned out by the heavy productions. Didn't care for Dressin Up. This 
album is great for what it is but don't expect any masterpieces. "
"Def her best album I just love her!! She has the best sound. I have every one of her songs on 
my phone and I cannot stop listening to her! She is the best singer and 
hardly ever uses auto tune. Just one question though. Which song exactly is 
Explicit? I don't hear a single swear word in this album "
"Thank you Katy Perry. You have help me get through some rather sticky spots 
in my life lately. So as long as you keep your chin up. I will to Thanks for you Katy Perry. You have helped me through some sticky 
situation in my life. So as long as you keep your head up I will try to do 
the same. "
"Flop and fake So she is a basic radio only pop star. This album is a joke but fireworks 
was great. its the only thing off this that's worth at least one star. "
"3.5 Yea sure. She isn't really good a song writing but what are you expecting 
from a pop singer? Sure there is very catchy songs here but then she trying 
too hard . At least her songs are about love and that's all i gotta say.Rec 
Tracks: ""Wide Awake"", ""Its Not Like The Movies"", and ""The One That Got 
Away"" "
"Katy has an Amazing sound She's no rubber stamp for sure. A fantastic blend of pop and an element 
unique and all her own, every song amazes. Nobody like her out there. "
"Amazing This album inspires me.... all then song has something in them that 
touches me. Thank you katy perry. You made my life better "
"Nice album In the beginning I wasn't hooked, but I admit that I like most of the 
songs on this album. I don't know what the boys who gave 1 stars were mad 
at. Guess they wish they had the talent. "
"Love it! But a problem The album is awesome but you didnt need to make a new album by just adding 
three songs. Anyway the rest is awesome. "
"Katy parry@ Friday night . So awesome and so amazing so awesome and I love 
it Children I don't know girl but I'm really stoked I was saying I would send 
you a picture of me will be so pretty never ever ever but everything like 
everything would be fake God is junior church people are change and just a 
little help me it's painful actually BreakFree is the best song ever if you 
listen that I meant to listen to bang bang and I'm going to listen to our 
own things ready because I'm not to listenbang bang invent it bang bang and 
break free is the best s the best thing ever in the whole cool "
"Great Ha ha shut up bryan . Sticky situation, must have stepped in some glue! Ha 
geddit geddit! But yeh katy is a great musician "
"Katy perry's biggest fan ever I love every song she every sang and all of her songs speak to me I can 
not go a day without listening to her "
"Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection is the perfect pop album. Katy Perry 
is the voice of a generation. Hear her Roar!!! "
"Awesome! Best Album EVER!!! Katy is the greatest pop star of all time and no singer could ever replace 
her. I Love U Katy Sooo much:) Epic Album. "
"Inspiring! Exotic! Amazing! Katy, Once again you have astonished the world with your exotic elements! 
You've come a long way since I Kissed a Girl! I hope you keep up with this 
music. You are my muse and the moon in my night sky! Don't ever stop making

"Amazing Her music is always amazing, its even better knowing she wrote her own 
music too, I would have liked to see a special edition though with like a 
second disc with remixes or music videos, or even her California Dreams 
Tour "

Awesome Album 
Real talent 
"Thrive CASTING CROWNS Loved this album great lyrics and great beat with it too!! Modern worship 
is what are churches are lacking!! Treat yourself purchase today you won't 
regret it!! Happy Christmas TO ARE SAVIOUR AND KING!! May God continue to 
bless you casting CROWNS as you are awesome in music and lyrics! Your album 
Casting Crowns speaks to me especially the one about a flower dying it is 
an awesome song keep it up! Love in Christ Some glorious day we will meet!! "
"Broken together Best song ever!!!! We all feel this way sometime in our life! I also think 
of my adult children and the struggles they have had at different times. 
This song makes me cry because I know we just have to give our trials and 
tribulations over to the Lord. He will heal us, we just have to pray! "
"This album packs a Spiritual punch! Casting Crowns has always answered Christ commission to ""feed my Sheep"" 
but 2014's Thrive takes their musical pastoral ministry to new pastures 
with songs that cut to the quick yet speak Truth in love. ""Waiting on the 
Night to Fall"" is a musical ballad unlike any I've heard thus far. The song 
gently rebukes us for relegating God's scarlet letter to nothing more than 
a dusty Tome on a shelf. This album is worth picking up and listening to 
intently. "
"Wonderful cd Have a little for everyone But this album is amazing. I have been going 
great through a rough spot and broken together just brings tears to my eyes 
and makes me know that I'm not the only one that has walked this road. 
Thank you Casting Crowns "
"Great encouragements from Biblical texts Using the Bible as a foundation, Casting Crowns have once again put 
together an album with the wonderful gifts God has given them that is 
truthful, down-to-earth, and that brings the Gospel to life. Their songs 
are lyrically deep and real, and their music moves you to feel the true 
impact that your faith has on your life on this earth. I highly recommend 
this album for anyone, especially if you have been through suffering or 
felt confused by the things that happen in this world. "
"Broken Together Will always love Casting Crowns. Praying for Mark as he goes through his 
surgery. I heard Broken Together for the first time the day after I had a 
bad break up. God really healed my heart. Bless them Lord like they bless 
us. "
"Thrive By Casting Crowns is one of the best ever! ""Just be held"" helps me get 
through a day of rushing and craziness and reminds me I'm not alone in this 
journey, I can't do it all, sometimes I need to ""just be held"" and let God 
do the rest! "
"Broken together The lyrics of this song grabbed ahold of my heart when I realized that 
with God's help, my husband and I can be: ""broken"" & ""together""!! I'm 
sending my gratitude to Casting Crowns for these beautiful lyrics...and to 
God be the Glory that He can keep us ""together"" despite our ""brokenness"" 1 
Thess. 2:16 "
"Amazing! I have everyday struggles and this album really speaks to me. Actually as 
I was just thinking about how today was horrible ""Just Be Held"" came on. Im 
in awe of my incredible God. Great Album! Keep up the good work! "
"Follow me- Casting Crowns This song truely speaks of me, I have never felt loved, Because my mother 
never wanted me and made no bones about it. This song revealed what that 
""Little Girl inside me has always wanted to say, God has given me hope when 
I could not any, and follow me allowed that Little speak for the first time 
! Thank-you, from that little girl!! "
"Stop holdin' on... And ""Just Be Held""! I'm going through a tough, bad breakup. This song came 
on while I was crying the other day. Jesus, thank You for bringing me back 
into the light! I need to stop holdin' on to what's become toxic in my 
life, and just let You hold me. In Jesus name! <3 "
"Broken Together Some songs just draw out the deep quiet voice inside us that whispers how 
much we are broken, but there's hope in God's redemption in Yeshua/Jesus 
the Christ. This is one of those songs... "
"Praise God It strengthens me and many others to be reminded that we are not alone. 
These singers and all their fans are standing alongside us, standing strong 
and praising our Lord Jesus through the storm of this world. This album is 
amazing and faith-strengthening and just great to listen to. For all who 
read this you are not alone, we are standing next to you reminding you that 
no matter what is thrown at you, God is good. Remember, we are not alone, 
we have each other and even more, we have God. Praise God! "
"ive always liked chriatian music. especially casting crowns.....this album i actually had 
to sit down to listen to it. it made me think of alot of different things 
and actually brought me to my knees to pray. i enjoyed this album. "
"Inspiring. Helped me push through a very rough season. God can do all things and this 
album is a great way to be reminded of our Lord's power and love He has for 
us. "
"Disappointed!! All their music now sounds the same...both the lyrics and music. Their 
first album is still the best. "
"Wow What An Album Iv'e allways liked casting crowns a song here and there but this album in 
a whole is pretty awesome. Just the fact that every song is biblically 
acurate is enough to make this good but the music and the vocals make it 
Great... "
"great artist I feel this bad is the best band when it comes to this type of music. They 
have there way to really feel and hear there music they even help when you 
are stressed or even down. Great job casting crowans keep it :-) "
"This cd Is amazing and this song is my favorite one! In case you guys didn't know 
it's about apostle Paul. "
"Love all their music If you don't feel the Holy Spirit I'm shocked I feel God's presence when I 
listen to them "
"Thrive is the best song for me. It has helped me to remember that with 
Christmas I'm not just living but thriving! "
"Broken together I really like this song...i feel like I am able to relate...and at the 
same time wanting the same from who ever comes into my life... "
"Whew its awesome! I love almost all of their songs, and this new album is just as amazing as 
their old ones! It's uplifting, but still not too perky.. Get it! "
Broken Together Profoundly deep and a song I think many of us can relate to! 
"Broken together Most amazing song. Thank you for taking the time to make such a genuine 
song. "
"Thrive. . I love this album. . It truly speaks to my heart. I listen to it all day 
over and over again. Its uplifting beautiful words can't explain . The Lord 
has truly blessed this band with the holy spirit thru music. "
Broken together Such a touching song.. speaks to my soul love this album 
"Just be held got me through the loss of my mother. I was sure my world was 
falling apart and the lyrics were like they were written for me. "
"My sad song My sad song is broken together because he is really right like he says""The 
only way will last forever is broken together""So sad "
"Amazing Every song on this album connects with me. It is yet another example of 
God using Casting Crowns music to spread His message and Love to this 
world. The fruit that comes from this group is felt and seen in every song. "
Love it.! Songs Speck So Loud AND clear♡ 
Broken Together Perfect for troubled marriages. 
"Awesome album I've been waiting for this release and I wasn't disappointed. Great job 
guys. God bless "
"I love casting crowns songs they hit the spot to nourish my soul and I have 
a great and blessed day. And I would recommend people to listen to them 
there great Amen! "
"I love this song so much Well I didn't know that was the title but I love it, it's so good and the 
lyrics and so... I don't even know how to describe it but it's got a good 
message "
Broken together This song spoke to me so much. I've always felt broken. 
"One day every knee will bow in heaven earth n beneath the earth;acknowledge 
JESUS is LORD.HIS people will cast our crown at HIS feet;too bad it isn't 
past tense. "
"Stand up for Jesus and god everyone these people are bringing me closer to 
him "
"Powerful Truth... Great straight ahead powerful Truth in love...I especially like 
BrokenTogether... "
My favorite speaks to me band Christian hope filling songs 
"Triciapv226 All about That Bass is the jam! Size acceptance, self esteem, self 
acceptance, and pride are all trumpeted in that song. Teaching kids of all 
sizes, colors and types that if someone doesn't accept you for you, ""than 
go ahead and move along"" is a strong message. The second and third songs 
are ok. Close your eyes could be a hit. "
"Love Meghan trainor Meghan Trainor incorporates everything I love in these songs, especially 
in the staticy beginning of her song Dear Future Husband. I personally rate 
the songs. 1. Dear Future Husband 2. Title 3. All About That Bass (and) 4. 
Close Your Eyes (being at the bottom because I haven't heard it yet) "
"Amazing! As a woman who needs special attention to feel good, I was always afraid 
of looking inside myself and finding absolutely nothing. But thanks to 
these great songs, I know that all my problems are actually my boyfriends 
fault! Everyone is obligated to love me and tell me I'm pretty, regardless 
of the fact that I am slowly killing my wonderfully healthy 300kg body. I 
am perfect. Thanks Meghan! "
"Hypocritical lyrics All about that bass talks about loving your body no matter what then goes 
on the shame people who are thin. then says men like booty which goes to 
say you need a mans validation . Its horrible. Contradicting. Gross. Its 
free and im not downloading it "
"Such a ""catchy"" little album!! From what I hear just by listening to these few previews, this girl has 
got it all! She's definitely not afraid of rejection & could care less who 
likes her & who doesnt...with that being said, I am a fan! She has an 
oldies vibe to her, but her lyrics are definitely in this time & era! You 
should definitely 'feel' her music & get in her ""groove""! Really like her & 
her style.Very different! Hoping that there is more of her & much more of 
her unique talent! Come on with this album...can't wait to hear more!!! "
"Hated it! My daughter won't stop Singing ""All about the base"". Wish I would have 
kept the receipt, (for my daughter... I never bought the album). "
"Truly love theses songs! She is so inspirational and has a beautiful voice. I love how her songs 
remind me of the 1950's. I play all about that bass when ever my cousin 
tells me shes fat and it always puts a smile on her face. "
"Fit the Mold, I suppose Overall, very bland and unimaginative. Unsigned bands have more talent 
lyrically and instrumentally, and its sad to hear this as popular instead. 
Furthermore, this woman is doing nothing but sending bad messages. 
Conforming to patriarchal stereotypes does not make for a good life lesson. 
Nor does hating on someone for being skinny (or fat). Why not just accept 
people and listen to good music? TL'DR: Sad I can't give zero stars. "
"More like 10 stars Meghan Trainor is so inspiring. Quote for All About That Base; she is so 
right girls are so mean to themselves and mainly about how that look. Every 
one is pretty, kind and should be loved♥♥♪♪♥♥ "
