"Dope I downloaded earlier and man its a banging album. Future did a great job 
on this album. Support the artist!!! "
"meh I do like it but its not the best my favorite is fun now that's a good 
song! "
"It's not at all the type of rap that shouldn't have TWO Songs in the top top ten I've listened to Iggy's album and his and it's 
pretty bad in my opinion, I usually love listening to white rappers but 
when it comes to pitbull and iggy they just need to quit, "
"Aye Papi I love Pitbull. He comes up with great dance music. He always throws in 
different styles like samba, r&b,and hip hop. Then mix in some great 
collaborations with great artists, you get a great album. "
"It's Alright I'll say this album is not bad but not the best eaither. He could of done 
much better than this. The album has a few good songs but not all of them. 
The one with Chris Brown to my opinion is terrible. But again that's my 
personal taste. Overall is an OK album. "
"What is this? Moby? Fell off since m.i.a.m.i. Now that was some legit hip hop. He went hard 
back in the day. This is just techno pop. "
"Gotta say... I was not excepting this. This is a very entertaining album. It does it's 
job. Pitbull even brought back a little Miami bass with ""This is not a 
drill"". Excellent for a party with dance music but has a nice mix of pop 
and hip-hop; a combo that Pitbull is now famous for. It may not win a 
grammy but it sure puts a smile on your face. "
"Awesome I love pit bull he always comes up with lots of new song that are cool and 
catchy "
"Love this song I loved this song before it got popular and played over and over on the 
radio and I love it it very upbeat and cool "
"Great job BUEN CD LE DOY 4 ESTRELLAS OUT TO 5 ,POR LA SENSILLA RASON ESPERABA MAS DE 
PITBULL,PERO EL CD QUEDO EXCELLENTE WORLDWIDE 305 PA LANTE APOLLANDO LA 
VERDADERA MUSICA Y LA MUSICA BUENA.. "
Time of our lives I absolutely love his music would love to meet him one day !!! 
Great songs good songs and a few bad overall really good 
"Smh... I only really liked one song, and its the one with ne-yo, time of our 
lives, other than that this album is not all that "
"PITBULL GLOBALIZATION PITBULL my number one singer in the world I love all is music !!! Number 
one fan Emma Nava aka little PITBULL!!! "
"Love it! Pitbull I could go without, but when Ne-Yo is in it, it's a symphony. "
I payed for Fireball and it didn't give me the song. I WANT A REFUND! 
"Alright His music isn't original anymore, just the same old modern pop "
"I think I hat if I had a chance to meet pitbull I wood take it a then can't 
BC he is HOT ,SEXY ,YOUNG oh yah yumy Slow what a man .I wish that he was my every thing I to 1. "
Wow One of pit bulls best albums yet.My favorite one though is FIREBALL. 
"Pitbull is always the same never different. I would buy it if Pittbull 
weren't in it "
She's on fire she is so hot I'm no lies she burning the spot Love is mostly fireball and time of our lives 
"OMG GOOGLE! So OMG when I first heared we are one, I wasnt impressed but after hearing 
it on here luv it "
"AWESOME!!! I especially love fireball get this album. If you hate this music you are 
CRAZY "
Crap Like usual. His first was his best ever since his albums have been crap. 
Fire ball This song is very catchy. I can stop singing it 
"Ah ok..ish Been a pit fan since he was doing shows in south Florida before the record 
deals....he's a pop artist now ... lost his roots "
"Cool My favorite song of pitbull is fireball I know that song real long time 
ago that song is in my head I can not stop singing that song everyday "
Pit bull Globalization Killed it... and that's a compliment 
Speechless I love this song so much this just gets me so happy when things go wrong 
"Hated it Sound like his dick is too far inside his body, which makes him have a 
vajina "
"Time of our life's Even thoe I'm not rly a pit bull fan I am a ne-yo fan but I LOVE THIS SONG 
SFM "
Cool I love the song time of our lives and wild wild love 
I love this song and you guys should try out vacation by G.I.L 
"Not ws good this time. All artists get cocky,after sucses. And after the first two albums hit 
big, the artist want to branch out,thats when they flop. I enjoy the dance 
music disco house techno, not the booty vibe this album has. Its good 
music, but not what i expect of mr worldwide. And cris breezy. They need to 
give us more of what made them popular because thats what the fans want 
buy. "
"Pit bull's music is very infectious and danceable. A lot of people say he 
is wack but if you dancing ain't that what it's bout ? "
ONE Sexy Pitbull He just makes you smile. & Wanna start Dancing! ! 
Pitbull I love pit bull TIME OF OUR LIFE 
I love your song my favorite is time of our life 
"Like it ..... Kinda Omg wat is wrong with america ! PIT BULL IS LIKE 48!!!!!! UR ACTING LIKE 
HE'S 35!!!!! HE'S A OLD MAN FREAKS (think I might barf !)but neyo is 
asomeness but I got to amit pit bull good at job "
I love that song yo cool Dillard's again I like it the video awesome dude 
Wow his career is going sky high Very nice album. 
"Standing Ovation for ""Stages"" Ok, I know it hasn't been released yet, but just the fact alone that Josh 
Groban is releasing an album of songs from the stage is reason enough for 
me to applaud it and give it five stars. Not to mention the fact that he's 
done a duet of ""All I Ask of You"" (from ""The Phantom of the Opera) with the 
exquisite Kelly Clarkson. Can't wait till this comes out! "
"This is the first of many albums featuring show tunes that I hope Josh 
makes. There are so many more tunes I would love to hear him cover However, 
as the first one, I think he did a great job selecting songs that feature 
his voice to best advantage and that reflect varying styles and from shows 
with diverse topics. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys 
musical theater. I look forward to hearing him perform more on a second and 
third album of similar music...there are so many still waiting for his 
lovely baritone to grace them...I can hear songs from Fiddler on the Roof, 
South Pacific and more.in my head already! "
"This album is just as good as any of his previous work. He did a great job 
picking songs that are suited to his style. The only criticism I have is 
his choice to sing Pure Imagination, but that's only because I don't like 
that song to begin with; he sings it just as well as any of the others 
though. If you like any of the shows these songs are from, you are pretty 
much guaranteed to like his version of them all. "
"What a gift to my ears and the world! THANK YOU to You Josh Groban and 
Thank you GOOGLE PLAY for this free download! Love all the music of Stages "
"Some good, some falls flat. The added lines to Pure Imagination are nice, and the duets in general do 
well. It feels a bit overdressed though sometimes. "
"This is a wonderful Christmas gift. Thank you very much. I've been a fan of 
you since first hearing you long before you became famous. This is a 
delight! "
"Beautiful! I've been a fan since the beginning. I checked out many of the tunes on 
his Youtube page. I was/am simply amazed. So inspirational. Keep up the 
good work Josh!!! "
I never thought I'd ever hear so many songs ruined on one album. Please never ruin another's music with your voice again. 
"Swoon This album is so classy! Makes me want to slip into a ball gown, and eat 
by candlelight. The bad reviews must be from people who've had their minds 
fried from too much pop music. "
It's Josh.. Does it need any other recommendation? Fabulous. 
"Love it I love his voice... its dumb though how Google play still makes you put in 
a card number or PayPal. I don't have either so I can't download the album: 
/ "
"What a nice Christmas present. I love your voice and this album have beautiful songs in it. Thank you for 
you generosity. Best wishes on your nomination I hope you win "
"I love his music thisis suppose to free it wants my credit card info and 
other. I should not have to provide that...... "
God Given Talent Josh Groban is one of my favorite singers he has a beautiful voice 
"His voice is amazing and it is the best orchestration I ever heard - the cd 
is phenomenal. I play it every day. "
I can hardly wait to hear Josh Groban in concert in Dallas next week!!! 
LOVE JOSH GROBAN Thanks Josh so much for this Christmas gift. Blessings to you. 
"Great Very good, can't wait for part 2... Not much theater in Louisiana "
"two thumbs up I didn't know what to expect from this album, but once i listened to it I 
loved it. great songs! "
Love I like his voice & songs 
Already know it's going to be great. 
Where do u get the code to redeem..... 
just in time seeing him next week 
Great songs Just not my everyday music. Maybe as background noise. 
"Spectacular! ! A must-have even if not a Josh Groban fan. Absolutely incredible, so well 
done, beautiful mix. "
"Amazing artist and heavenly beautiful music Thank you, Google! for this amazing album. Josh is extra talented 
vocalist! "
Josh I Love His Voice.. 
Stages Wonderful. Loved every song . Voice absolutely perfect 
"Wow! What a collaboration with Kelly Clarkson. Her powerful high entrance 
really blew me away! Absolutely stunning duet with Josh Groban. "
"Stages Fantastic, a journey through shows on or off Broadway, sung by a true, 
giving, caring performer. "
Stages Brings a tear to our eyes 
Stages by Josh Groban Beautiful 
This is really nice to listen to. This is really nice to listen to. 
Stages is amazing! Thanks for offering it free on Google Play! 
Great songs Beautifully done pick this album up. 
"Josh Groban is fabulous in this album. Full of great songs from shows - 
easy to listen to, be motivated and make your spirit soar! Kudos for Josh, 
hope there is a Stages 2 in the works! "
Amazing. I wish I had just 1/2 of his talent. 
My #1 album 
Beautiful 
Love him! 
"Something different. Took a minute to get used to the new direction he chose to go in on this 
new LP but after listening to it a couple of times. I can honestly say it's 
grown on me. Drop your expectations of what you expect him to do and just 
give it an unbiased listen. You'll have a good time with it. Not for 
everyone but nothing ever is. "
"Huge disappointment! !! I've been listening 2 rap/hip hop since the 80's & have seen how it's 
evolved in the last 30yrs.And where musica is now just sucks! Dre fans have 
been waiting for this album for 10+ years & we had very high expectations 
because of every album he's produced has been a masterpiece!I was expecting 
more of chronic type album.But I wanted 2 hear more of 50 Cent,Eminem,Old 
Snoop,Gunit,the Game & then throw in a little justin bieber on the 
tracks..Just F-ing which you!I know I'm old.but that's what I was expecting "
"Haha Seriously, dre feeds of the haters, he's the only artist that's been 
around for 30 years that still make a difference in the game. The only 
artist that can switch up his sound and make it kill. I love the fact that 
in almost every song he says he don't care what anyone thinks he does his 
thing. Dre was born from hate. He never cared about anyone thinks. Nothing 
will compare to his early works but he still got it. "
"Amazing Dre proved just how terrible rap/hip-hop has become. This is true 
production, quality music with rapping blended well. "
I listened to this track over and over again Dre doing his thing now give us the album we been waiting for PLEASE 
"Took me about 6 listens to feel each song and what Direction he went with.but once it grows on you .it effen grows on 
you..all classics have Been that way for me "
"Its too outsourced. Dre is barely on his own album as a rapper. And we get 
it, you feel sorry for Eazy-Z. Ughhh. "
"Brilliant album and a fantastic movie If you're like me, in the 90s I was in my 20s and I stumbled across this 
practically unknown at the time. The NWA as they appeared on The Word on 
Ch4 back in the 90s. I watched their performance and I was hooked. I said 
to myself, this rap music is something that'll explode onto the music scene 
in a way that nobody realised. I was right, as it did and it's still with 
us today. Okay granted what was then and what we have today I'd a former 
shadow of itself. Watch the movie when it comes out, it's awesome. "
"Freakin lovvvveeee this alum Im a dr dre fan. Listening to all four of my older brothers growing up 
playing dre sounds. Its different. Something that u can enjoy. He gave u 
something to think about! And give u something to let u know the rap game 
today is wack and corny. This album prove it ALL. great album dre. Will 
always be your biggeat fan!!!! "
"I really did forget about dre until straight outta cpt came out. This album 
is a must-buy. Kendrick was nuts & Anderson paak killed it! Wasn't 
expecting dre to give him that kind of attention. It was badass to hear 
cube spit again too "
"Kendrick Lamar did his thing All the songs that featured Kendrick in it was straight Kendrick never 
lets me down "
"Worth a listen Why would Dr. Dre make another chronic? This is 2015. If he had you'd 
complain about him regurgitating the same ol' music. He's using more live 
instruments as opposed to sampling George Clinton or Roger and Zapp. That's 
played out. Kendrick did something similar. Respect to them for moving the 
west coast sound forward. "
"Powerful Production When I first heard dr dre was coming out with a new album I was like oh ya 
just another rumour and then bamo it was out and when I finally listened to 
it was like something over the top the production level on this album is 
off the charts, from start to finish it blew me away hit after hit. 
Powerful. "
"Johnny love songs from songs by right music's from the best out best to 
start of rape music's. I love songs back in time when all come in rimes and place went all time 
you and more dance for dance too in and on the street dance ... "
"Really different I'm a huge fan of that 1990s ""G Funk"" sound that many artists have 
abandoned at this point in the game so I was really hoping that Dre would 
bring that back, if not then something with the same vibe. I have to say 
that this album sounds nothing like the old sound but it still has some 
dope beats in it. The one place where this album has really dissapointed me 
is in the quality. If you listen to Dre's older stuff it sounds really 
good. Like you can hear the spit in his mouth. This sounds over driven. "
"Dr Dre at his best This is absolutely hands down the best produced album in Dr Dre carrier 
his production and sound quality is excellent. All the artist on here sound 
great . Everyone is looking for that chronic sound and a true Dre fan will 
know the sound is there. Signature Dr Dre big ups for this album "
"Doctor Who?......... Dr. DRE that's Who! Whenever Dre does anything new, peoples are always 
gonna be critical. Originality is always gonna bring criticism. Haters are 
generic. I remember the first time I heard his first solo album. I was 
expecting NWA sounds. Nope, Dre produced something new for our listening 
pleasure. This album has done exactly the same. He's flipped the script in 
his typical way and what we have is a classic in the making. Just like 
Chronic and 2001. Dre's back fools...go get your radioactive suites and 
body armour cause this one's gonna blow..... BOOOM! Do not sleep on this 
album. It's DOPE. "
"Did it again. Exactly the same way I felt after 2001 dropped. Hated it on first 
listening because the sound was so different but then had it on repeat 
forever. 10 stars! "
"Clean Its not the dre i expected but still love the production. More upto date 
and easily better than all that ""turn up"" bs "
"Another masterpiece! For those of you looking for G-Funk. You won't find it in this album. This 
man is an artist. An evolving one at that. You have to appreciate the 
messages within music. ""Did I fall off? Got you in your room ripping every 
chronic poster on your wall off. Just cause I put away the sawed off. Now I 
got you sitting back with a smirk listening with your arms crossed."" "
"This l.p this is one the best l.p doc has ever came up with it just seems to amaze 
me on how much better he is getting he is got eminem Kendrick Lamar in the 
game on the road to be in legends who needs to detox its 420 all day 
everyday "
"Exceptional and fantastic Another exceptional release from dr dre. Because of its release being so 
long since chronic 2001 hopefully this generation can appreciate it. I 
definitely do because it is Dr Dre, plain and simple. "
"X, Cube, Kendrick, Eminem, and the Doctor, what more could you ask for in 
hip-hop? This album is beyond dope, its crazy to witness Dre evolve to new 
levels, a lot different then any other Dre album but its still so Dre. I 
dont even know what to do with myself. FINALLY, thank you Dr. Dre. "
"Album was great! Really think Dre needs to put out more music. He never 
disappoints! Songs never get old even after heavy replay...lol "
"Disappointed After 14 years and the rollercoaster of waiting for Detox, this is what 
you give us? Em and Game are the only two that seemed to care. I wish I 
would have ""forgot about Dre."" "
"Dre always does his thing As far as what people expected I didnt think either of DREs chronic albums 
would be topped here, those are hands down classics, but in a different way 
this album is good none the less... Dosent have that classic feel on it but 
it delivers killer verses from some of hip hops best all on one album... Em 
killed his verse, dre delivers decent vocals as usual, kendrick is decent 
but way over rated in my opinion "
"I just ""now"" listened to the anticipated Dr. Dre - ""COMPTON"" LP (w/out 
skipping thru 1 song)... And... I didn't even have to listen to it twice to already say... this is 
the proverbial 5 Mics (via) Source Mag. This is an XXL (via) XXL Mag. What 
I'm trying to say is, this is INEVITABLY going to be a CLASSIC! Classic 
LP's like RAEKWON - ""Only Built For Cuban Lynx"" / NAS - ""Illmatic"" / The 
Notorious B.I.G. - ""Ready To Die"" / MOBB DEEP - ""The Infamous"" / BIG PUN - 
""Capital Punishment"" / Jay-Z - ""Reasonable Doubt"" (plus many more). Y'all 
get my point, the ""Compton"" LP will (in time) become a Classic, too! "
"With some, it took a few listens to get used to, but with me, it took only 
one listen. This album is insanely good. Every track has something special 
to offer, whether it's a banging rhythm or an astounding performance from 
Anderson .Paak and Kendrick Lamar. Get your mind away from The Chronic and 
change your perspective of music when listening to this. You'll find 
yourself amazed at how far Dre has come. "
"It's not his best Now this is a very good album given that we have fakes like drake and meek 
today. But....it's no where near the chronic or 2001, those are both two 
amazing albums that will never be forgotten. Now give the songs in this are 
pretty good, listen to the lyrics, learn what they mean, and you'll love 
it. I think this is worth a buy...but. For all you dre fans like myself 
don't expect anything spectacular, it doesn't have a g funk vibe at all 
sadly. But it's still good regardless. I actually sing the lyrics. "
"Grade: A- (Favorite Tracks: Genocide; All On Me; Darkside; Loose Cannons; 
Issues; Deep Water; One Shot One Kill; Just Another Day; Animals; The Diary 
// Least Favorite: Gone; For The Love Of Money) This album is great. Just the music on here makes this album great. What I 
love is that Dre had gotten new people for this project. Anderson .Paak is 
really start to grow on me a lot. Especially King Mez and Justus. Can't 
wait to hear what Anderson has to offer. But, anyway, I love this project. 
At first, I thought this was average, but the more I play it the more it 
grows on me. "
"West Coast fell off, but.. When the west coast was hot, it was fire. Darker, witty, heart thumping 
beats, and just over all amazing music. I love the sound, it's nice, crisp, 
and just as dark/gritty from back in the day. Influences from old school 
hip hop, rock, and twisted with some new sounds. Highly enjoyable. The only 
thing I didn't like was the sudden segue from track-track-sound-sound.. 
I'll be invested into a song than another beat, another song will kick in 
and it would throw me for a loop. But overall, much needed. "
"One of the best rap albums of all time This combines so many of the greatest known rappers and introducing new 
ones.it tells different stories of each of the artists lives with each 
song.shows how ice cube, snoop, and dre have changed and matured over the 
years.rap now a days is just some guy High mumbling catchy words over a 
beat,THIS is art .love it "
New type if rap There are a few tracks I'm digging but it's not bad a lil different 
"Very disappointed I can't believe Dre released a movie soundtrack instead of an album. What 
a load of trash. There is absolutely no rhythm. There isn't a song on here 
that will stick with you. You will never remember any of these songs or get 
them stuck in your head. Do not waste your money on this trash. I seriously 
hope that Dre only released this ""album"" to keep the leakers and people 
distracted while he works on a Real Album. "
"Idk why so many good reviews People expect more than mediocre after 14 years off when the other albums 
were masterpieces. This album is watered down and it isn't close to what 
people come to know in love with Dres usual sound. Seems like Compton is a 
poor title choice when you have lost your roots and sold out. Should have 
stayed retired and revered as a music mogul iconic legend. That said it 
probably sounds a little better the more you listen. Just doesn't hit you 
like his usual stuff has. "
"Legendary He brought it...his music always has that west coast groove oriented beats 
which is missing from this drum and bass world we live in...which I 
love...I believed he incorporated some of that in this project..great 
lyrics....I even think he stepped himself up a bit in the mc game..these 
kids today are used to their watered down hip hop "" goo goo gah gah""music 
so much that they don't know true musicianship when they hear 
it....unfortunately.. WESTSIDE!!!!! "
"Alright Dr. Dre is the foundation of all of "" Gangster Rap"" since 1988. 
Without Dre there would be no Snoop, Eminem, 50 and countless other 
artists. He is almost like the master of all of rap and his mixing skills 
are amazing. I understand he has to keep up with today's standards and 
modernize the music. I get it thats what Dre does he has always delivers us 
new fresh music. However, his flow kinda died off with his age. He is over 
shadowed by great artists like Kendrick, Game and Eminem. I think this 
album was an appropriate end to his legacy and that the younger generation 
of rappers such as The Game and Kendrick Lammar will continue Dre's and 
N.W.A's legacy for decades to come "
Was expecting a little better.. but it wasnt bad! I only purchased a few songs 
"If dre put out detox you still wouldn't have like it. It wouldn't have 
lived up to the hype. Any album dre put out after a 16 year wait was never going to live up to 
the hype. Putting that to the side what you get is not a classic. It's 
dre's worst solo album, but when his other two albums are the chronic and 
2001, worst is still better than many people's best albums. Appreciate this 
piece of music for what it is in the time it was released. Dre did this for 
the fans, and this album while not a classic is a special and rather good 
piece of music. "
"Great Album! Loved It! I Love what Dre did with this Album! It takes Serious Guts to come out 
with a Totally new sound like this. Most Artists as big as Dr Dre wouldn't 
dare abandon the style that made them Famous! I Love it! "
"Not too bad I like this album, though I wouldn't go as far to say it is exceptional, 
it is fairly good. It isn't anything amazing, or groundbreaking in my 
opinion but it is worth a listen. Check it out if you're an AC/DC fan. "
"Legends I really don't know what some people are moaning for? This is AC/DC at 
their classic best. Truly the greatest rock band of all time. My only 
criticism is that it's not long enough purely because I can't get enough of 
them. "
"Rock or Bust :-AC/DC Classic AC/DC LYRICS AND SOUND, LOVED IT, EVEN WENT TO THIS RELEASES TOUR 
OF AUSTRALIA WHEN IT IT SYDNEY!! They Boys are getting long in the tooth 
but still have that legendary sound and AC/DC Charisma & onstage persona!!! 
Just in case its their last live ontour stage concert, I wouldn't have 
missed it for the WORLD !!! Wished I had bought tickets for 2 nights not 
just the one, no matter got some Legendary collectables and souvenirs from 
the concert Sydney Olympic Park, 1 of My reatest lifetime "
"POP???? I have everything theyve put out. I have no prob listening to these tunes. 
I enjoy about 80 % of the new songs. BUT....definitely not the true deep 
down grit that we are used to. Almosts sounds like a cover band leaning to 
the pop side. Fun to listen to but with a few scotch in my belly brain...I 
will be screaming the old ACDC tunes,,, not this. "
"Support Bulgaria I don't know why it's unavailable in Bulgaria but please remove this 
restriction because we love AC/DC "
"ROCK ON AC/DC, can't go past them for a good rock album, will sound good 
going down the highway at full noise. "
"Rock or Bust I'd like to see Dr Dre put out anything close to being this good after 40 
years "
"never stops rocking. this is a relentless hard rocking album from start to finish the only 
thing lacking is the length from start to finish. but it's all good 
songs... there is no filler on it. and definitely much harder rock than the 
last 3 albums although I'd say Black Ice beats it due to sheer amount of 
good and varied tracks. This album is a relentless rock fest from start to 
finish. They are defo at full rocking swing on this album and no rock fan 
will be disappointed by this purchase. "
"AC/DC I swear they will never let me or anyone down. Their albums are always 
amazing!! "
"Dogs of War! This is a great album. Maybe not the best when in comparison is previous 
AC/DC albums but definitely great. I'm still glad this band is still 
producing quality. "
"Good, nearly worthy of 5 stars!:) Don't get my wrong... I enjoyed the tracks however... Songs get a little 
bit repetitive with AC/DC for example... Dogs of War, is not really a good 
track at all... But Rock or Bust, Play Ball and Rock the blues are amazing 
tracks!:) ROCK IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
"Rock or bust Not the best AC/DC album and after years of waiting I expected more apart 
from play ball , rock or bust and dogs of war its on a par with fly on the 
wall please don't go out like this boys I'm a massive fan and don't want 
you to end it with this album but I fear this will be their last album and 
last tour in 2015 "
"Band sounds strong, yet the songs....not so much Long time fan and vividly recall instantly connecting to multiple songs on 
each album, except Black Ice. This time, ....no connection. Sadly this is 
two albums in a row that missed the target. Also, what's up with 'Rock the 
Blues Away""? Sounds nothing like classic ACDC. Sounds more like their 
attempt to get back on the radio. "
"Excellent album Sound is so crisp and fresh. Aside from the excellent guitar work, Cliff's 
bass lines complemented the guitar perfectly, Phil's drumming was simple 
and perfect (thank god he showed up for the recording sessions) and Brian 
sounds different, but just as good as Back in Black album. No filler 
tracks, really badass sounding tracks. I wonder what it would have sounded 
like with Malcolm, but still an honourable way to end a career, if this is 
going to be their last album. "
"The Greatest Rock n Roll band of all time. Angus and the boys are back again, though obviously without Malcolm this 
time which is a genuine shame but these are the lads that came back after 
the loss of Bon (the greatest, best and most unique frontman that ever took 
to the stage... along with Jimi H he's the biggest loss to rock music.... 
in my opinion anyway).AC/DC, it's the comeback of the year,. made my year 
anyway, the decade and I just hope to hell I get another chance to see them 
live again...am a lifelong fan of the guys if you hadn't guessed. "
"Ac DC rules! This is truly hard rock at its best , can't understand why people,are 
hating on this album. If you're truly an ac /DC fan, you should appreciate 
it, I know that I do. "
"Still going strong Anyone that can still put ou a record as good as this 40 years after the 
masterpiece that High Voltage is well deserve legendary status. But the 
lads from AC/DC gained that 30 odd years ago. Ok it ain't the best AC/DC 
record there is none the less still top shelf rock n roll destined to 
become a classic. "
"Don't fix what isn't broken! The AC/DC formula. They are still using the same style they've been using for 40 years!! And 
they still rock. This album, while definitely not their best still offers 
some great Rock'n'Roll worth listening, especially if you're a fan. I had 
to listen the album 2 times to start liking it. There was something 
different at first. Maybe my expectations were different or maybe Malcolm's 
absence could really be felt. Who knows? Regardless, at the end, a solid 
album and much better than today's music. I really am glad they made it! "
"Classic AC/DC For most bands the fact one album sounds similar to another is a bad 
thing, not so with AC/DC, if this album didn't sound similar to their 
previous ones it would have been a disaster! Luckily they stick to the 
formula and you get exactly what you were looking for. Great album! "
"Amazing!! Every song on this album is worthy of getting stuck in your head all day 
and singing bits and pieces of it throughout the day. My expectations were 
high and these guys always blow it out the water! "
In rock we trust \m/ ❤ Definitely love this album. ACDC never cease to amaze me 
"Favourite album Rock or bust please acdc don't finish it on rock or bust please make 1 or 
2 more albums please your the best band in the world I would be so upset if 
the band is over after 42 years please acdc in rock we trust ( I hope you 
get better Malcolm) "
"R&R or BUST Generally what you would expect from Ac/Dc but i was pleased to discover 
more than a few surprisingly creative vocal melody hooks within the usual 
straight forward songs on this record. Its a nicely mixed album as well 
with a somewhat compressed live off the floor feel with nicely layered not 
overly imbelished vocal effects (for AC/DC) which helps them sound like a 
real band! "
"Awesome!!! Love this entire album!! So glad to listen to the great AC/DC's new music. 
If you know AC/DC then you know this is awesome!!! "
"AC DC Rock or Bust This is traditional ""rock'n"" AC DC. Awesome ... and the reason eave after 
all these years they are the top of the rockers! "
"Love it Cant believe that ac dc are still going hell yeah lets just hope the tour 
will top it off guys ☺ "
"Amazing Love acdc and love this album ...my favorite song on the album would 
probably be ""rock the blues away"" its a great tune "
"AC/DC Rock or Bust Another hard rockin forte for a band that just keeps on rockin through 
adversity and life's often hard lessons. "
"ACDC IS AND ALWAYS WILL WE THE #1ROCK BAND IN THE WORLD! WE LOVE YA &MISS 
YA MALCOLM BEST WISHES FROM A DIE HARD FAN TILL THE END!!!!!!! "
"Great! That's a great album,obviously not the best but it's a classic AC/DC 
album,I miss Malcolm on the rhythm guitar "
"Rock or Bust I can't wait till they go on tour. It'll be my first time seeing them in 
real life in concert. :-P "
AC/DC ROCKS OUT! Same great music they have been making all along. 
"They now have over 20 songs with rock in the title. Still love the band 
after all these years "
"I love it Im only sixteen and I love AC/DC. I've been exited for this album since 
the day I first know it was coming out. My dad bought this album as soon as 
he could. It has all of their classic sound. Great album! They never 
disappoint! "
"I love AC/DC But...my prayers and hopes of another cracking track like Dirty Deeds or 
even Let There Be Rock remains unanswered. "
"It's all a bit to much of the same sound to me,all the tracks sound pretty 
much the same,much prefer my other acdc albums "
"I like it Certainly not as good as their older material, but it's still good. Rock 
the Blues Away has to be my favorite songs on the album. Great stuff. "
"Great I love AC/DC I'm only 11 but they are just Great. I suggest it to anyone 
but the back on black album is way better. "
":/ All the song sound the same. I think it's safe to say AC/DC is past there 
prime "
"Rock or bust This album is why AC/DC was, is and will always be the GREATEST ROCK BAND 
EVER!!!! "
"Awesome Absolutely AMAZING! there's no other way to describe it! Definitely worth 
the money! Amazing album would 101% recommend! and I don't care how many 8 
year old girls argue with me, imagine dragons will always be better than 1D 
lol! "
"Amazing band, another amazing album I'm addicted to this album and Imagine Dragons (and the deluxe edition 
songs), that's all i have to say. They did a great job again! "
"Exceptional! Normally with albums you get a few awesome songs and the rest are a bit 
mediocre. This album is a definite exception. Every song on this album is 
brilliant, well crafted and enjoyable. In fact I'd go as far as saying this 
is one of my favourite albums ever! "
"Superb One of the best albums I've heard / bought in a long time not often you 
buy an album with so many great songs "
"Absolute quality What an album. Even my 5yr old son is obsessed with it and knows all the 
words to It's Time! So jealous if anyone going to see them in concert. "
"Brilliant Such good songs.. Radioactive, Demons, Bleeding Out, It's Time. Not a bad 
song on the album, Imagine Dragons are too good! "
"Amazing I love ID I saw them live and they were amazing, its not often you get an 
album where you like all the songs "
"Imagine Dragons = The Beat This album is so great I've known the before they came popular! Definite 
buy and at £1.99 CHEAP "
Adam Chadwick Demons is the best song and I want it to be the Christmas number1 
"I really like this I love radioactive I love radioactive its my favourite song and the beat is awsome I know 
this song by heart I listen to it that much lol:) "
"Love it This album is amazing, love there music. Love every song "

"Catchy Now i kno why fifa 13 chose on top of the world because when that song wuz 
playing i won busquets and pedro on fut "
Awesome Amazing songs. Great lyrics and intensity. Absolutely great band. 
"Imagine dragons night vission album This album meets all the entertainment needs and is a good album to buy 
and listen to on repeat at any time! "
"Great music... Imagine Dragons are one of the best new bands of 2013. At least three 
chart toppers on one album, plus many more great songs. A must buy! "
Favorite album I love imagine dragons ever since I've heard their first song. 
"LOVE THIS BAND!!! Perfect album, great sounds. All in all: BEST! "
"#GREATEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing album and these are one of my favourite bands in the world and 
they are making great pieces of music and I am sure people will agree and I 
can tell this album will be sold out in no time. "
Addicted It's great. They're my favourite band. They have the best songs. 
"Poor quality Sounds like a good set of tunes, but quality on decent headphones worst 
mp3 I have ever heard, shame. "
"Who can't love this? I was never really the indie rock type, but ID changed my views on the 
genre. "
"Amazing Radioactive, Tip Toe, Demons and Bleeding Out- those are the ones that I 
thoroughly enjoyed. Everything is just perfect... "

"Night Visions - Imagine Dragons One of the best albums I own on my tablet. All I listen to on my journeys. 
If you are a Arctic Monkeys, The 1975, Lawson, and basically a Alternative

overhyped. "

want to go backstage and meet them. Do you want to go backstage and meet 
them? "
Beautiful Hopefully a spanish version of this comes out too!❤ 
"It's not worth it, seriously. They are NOT a girl 'band' or 'rappers' they're music is repetitive and 
lyrics make no sense.How can they inspire any one if they seem fake they 
can try to write they're own music and it's not worth listening to. "
"With It... I love this song, makes me put a groove on. "
Good singers Good singers good harmony good songs 
Wow I loved every single one of their songs. 11/11 
"Not Too Thrilled. Each girl has an amazing voice, but their songs are a bit too repetitive. 
And on top of that, some of their lyrics are a bit... Shallow? "
Worth It is the only song I know so far & own but I love it lol 
Worth it I love y'all Dinah out there God bless you 
"I love 5H i am cracra if i didn't get to see them espically Dinah, Normani

meaning from your life I bet and Honestly I was a fan from day one and you

I love there songs! These songs are awesome and my favourite is Worth It! 
"They're so amazing! Nothing can beat these girls! This album is packed with great songs, I 
can't stop listening! "
Girl your voice is nice and smooth Your singing good ☺ 
"A solid and enjoyable album There's a lot more to Tove Lo than that hippie sabotage remix that 
consolidated her as a mainstream act. In fact, this album, which is divided 
on three parts of a relationship and songs about those parts, has lots of 
strong songs and some Ok ones,but is overall a nice work and a breath of 
fresh chillpop that was missing on the mainstream for quite a while(thanks, 
jason derulo). "
"Out of this world She's amazing, great look , power vocals & different sound... Way to go 
girl she deserves more recognition! WATCH OUT RIHANNA. "
"Tove Lo's voice sounds like something I have heard before...that something 
always makes me a little weak in the knees...chills "
"Queen Of The Clouds Best Album Ever, So Much Emotion "
"The best album ever I love you and your music keep the work. You are awesome one day you will 
break the world "
What can I say? She's absolutely amazing. 
Outstanding One of the best pop albums I've heard 
Love it. Melodies and voice is different. Good luck tove..... 
Amazing Im in love with her songs the lyrics are mind blowing

Patricia "
"Fabulous I love the movies so much and I have a friend who I'd obsessed with pitch 
perfect so it is something that we talk about alot "
"LUV IT I love the first movie and i LOVE the 2nd one even more! The beginning of 
the 2nd one was a little surprising lol and the ending of the 2nd one is 
very very very good. If you have not seen the 2nd one you really need to 
see it "
"This is an amazing movie I won't be able to stop watching it when it comes 
out on dvd and this is the best sound track I've ever listened to!! "
"Yeaa.... No I'm not really a fan of the movies and I feel the same for the songs in 
this album and the fact that this movie beat out mad max one of the best 
action movies in the past 5 or 10 year's sigh why are people so blind? 
Don't get me wrong the movie was OK but it sure as hell not better than mad 
max thank you very much "
"Haha Go fat Amy, we belong. Kidding, but awesome songs. O nd luvd the movies. I 
mean fat Patricia. O nd make more movies "
"Saw the midnight showing! They did a great job with music choice for the movie and packed it full of 
new songs :) "
"The song flashlight It's okay but it dosent make me happy or make me want to listen to it 
again "
"Love it! Most movies don't make me laugh, yet the entire time I was watching it I 
had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard! If that doesn't tell you 
something I don't know what will. "
"Spot on Well, it is the second time around... But thank goodness someone is making 
music that can be sung to make such happy sounds. I admit to being a total 
sucker for tight harmonies. Always have been. I might have picked a 
different song in one or two places, but that's just me. "
"AMAZING it was amazing my friends and I went to see it the first night it came out 
we couldn't wait the theater was packed it was so good hope you make a 3rd
