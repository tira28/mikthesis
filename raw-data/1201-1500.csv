"It's Time Tyler and Josh kill it on this album. I've listened to Regional at Best, 
Twenty One Pilots, Vessel, and now Blurryface and I must say, Tyler is an 
incredible musician. The amount of controversy and vulnerability he puts in 
EVERY. SINGLE. SONG. is something the industry is in serious lack of. And 
this album is no exception, though it's truly exceptional. I have been able 
to listen to this album back-to-back and the arrangement is incredible. 
Tons of variety, not only in the album, but the songs as well.***** "
"|-/ aMAZING ITS JUST SO FREAKIN AMAZING, EVERY SINGLE SONG IS PERFECTION TYLER 
& JOSH YOU HAVE DONE WELL. The must listen to's are probably Fairly Local, 
Heavydirtysoul, & Lane Boy (but the whole album is freakin amazing and take 
the time to listen to Message Man & Polarize) "
"Blurryface I enjoy every single song of the album, The Judge and Lane Boy are 
borderline however. Stressed Out is by far one of my all time favorite 
songs because of the lyric and rhyme scheme originality. Overall I 
definitely rate this album five stars! "
"Amazing band! Twenty one pilots is definitely twenty one genres merged into this band! 
Stressed out, Ride, and especially Fairly Local are my faves. I'm one of 
the few the proud and the emotional!!!! "
"Love them I think I made them popular everyone thought u ran their songs into the 
ground and then everyone was downloading their music and my sister hates 
music but LOOVVEESSS TØP and I love them more "
"The good stuff... Whatever the ""good stuff"" is... these guys find a way to deliver. Wide 
artistic range and the ability to please just about anyone with any song. 
Weather it be about conforming... March To The Sea (2009), is your song. 
Happiness, you've got House Of Gold (Vessel) and loneliness... you're 
spoiled for choice. This album is shaping up to be amazing, just like the 
artists themselves. "
"Yes please. Maintaining the unique, original sound is where this band excels. Always 
surprised, pleasantly, by Tyler and Josh's creativity. Being insecure and 
vulnerable has never been this much fun. "
"Favorite album of 2014 I've been a fan of Walk The Moon since the Tightrope EP was released, and 
I didn't think their next album could be better than their self-titled, and 
I was proven wrong! It has all type of moods, from upbeat to really dark 
(see Work This Body and then Up 2 U). Its a really fantastic album, and Im 
so excited what comes next for the boys! Favorite song: Spend Your $$$ or 
Portagual. "
"My favorite band now! I started listening to their songs because I had heard them on Pandora. I 
listened to some other songs. Soon, they became my favorites. "
"Reluctant Listen I was never a big fan during their first album, but when someone 
recommended this album on twitter, I had to listen. I was blown away. Every 
song is so catchy and fun. Portugal is my favorite. Probably makes my top 
five albums of 2014. "
"This is so Fun~ I love these guys! My fave song is Down in the Dumps! So flippin' good! 
Highly recommend this album while it's free! "
"Love it Shut Up And Dance and Different Colors are my top 2 in this album.EPICCC 
but there are only a few songs i like but its a great album "
"shut up and dance with me omg this song is amazing i listen to it over and over again one of my 
favorite songs that this group has made "
"Not my taste Google keeps recommending them and it's just not what I'm in to...hoping a 
bad ratting stops the obsessive recommending of them. "
"This its great! All of you who didn't give this fibre stars have no taste. This album is 
one off the best albums that i have ever heard. My favorite song from the 
album is shut up and dance, and my favorite song in general is shut up and 
dance. GET THIS ALBUM!!! "
"Love it I love the songs and the band. If people hate them, I don't care. I just 
love them "
"Ugh Well the only song in here that I like is shut up and dance but I think if 
you guys keep trying maybe you can please everyone "
"Love I love shut up and dance it's so awesome wish I new the words to it :( but 
it's cool "
Shut up and dance with me Love it love it love it love it just love it 
"SHUT UP AND DANCE WITH ME IT IS SO CATCHY IT IS STUCK IN MY HEAD LIKE FIFTH HARMONY WORTH IT AND 
DEMI LOVATO I REALLY DONT CARE "
"Loved it Awesome song for those who saw my last comment i found the problem it was 
my own dumbness. I rate it 5 stars cause the songs r awesome and love this 
band! "
"Modern Pop-Rock Staple Let me preface this by stating that, despite being a long-time supporter 
of Pop music, I have noticed a significant decline in the overall quality 
of ""modern radio"" music, both in content and delivery. Walk the Moon's 
release, Talking is Hard, is like an oasis among the anemic, recycled pop 
tunes of recent years. They combine an Indie mind with an 80's Revival 
heart in a sonic rollercoaster ride that will guide you back to a time of 
content-rich, relatable, extraordinarily catchy choruses and hooks. 9/10. "
"Not what I expected I know bands evolve and develop but this isn't what I had in mind. They 
may have gotten too artsy/trendy for their own good. Absolutely adored the 
first album. Saw them in concert about two years ago with Bad Veins, 
arguably the best concert I've ever seen but this new album has yet to 
touch me. Yet to suprise and wow me. I hope it's coming but I won't hold my 
breath... "
"Best album ever This album is amazing and uplifting. I went to their March 10th San Diego 
concert and my boyfriend proposed to me during ""Portugal,"" which is my 
favorite song. Gotta love Walk the Moon. "
"It's too bad they sound too much like a typical boyband in most of these 
songs... There are a few songs that represent what they're capable though "
Omg so good Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. 
"Walk the Moon is Fantastic This album has a perfect, fun feel to it. All the songs have their own 
distinct style, yet they all fit together as uniquely Walk the Moon. This 
album is filled with fantastic songs that are a blast to listen to. "
"Shut up and dance I loved it such cool album and songs. I love the front cover of the song 
album. Walk the moon has done soso cool songs they have done so well 
creatng the song albums and the songs. Well done again walk the moon. Love 
from hannah who is your number one fan. Hannah kingston "
"Great progression from last album Love the continued evolution WTM has shown from their self-titled album. 
Not afraid to grow and try new things, WTM nailed this. Portugal is insane 
and Come under the Covers is older song that finally has a studio version! 
Many others are splendid, check it out! "
"Love it, love , love it!#dream song I love the song Shut up and dance with me. It has a good beat to it !!! "
"Mind blown! I've never instantly fallen in love with an entire album so quickly! Their 
sound is perfect! Fun, upbeat, unique! Love love love! "
"Ugh I wish they would SHUT UP!! This is stupid and annoying...just stop. -_- 
And talking ISN'T HARD, JUST MOVE YOUR MOUTH.WHY DO YOU PEOPLE LIKE THIS 
OVER ""See You Again""???!!!!!! "
"I reviewed this album for the school paper Walk the Moon is very big at my school and I know that if I wrote an album 
review on it, people would read it. I knew Ana Sun and Shut Up and Dance 
but when I first listened to this album, it sounded very pop. It's a 
well-produced album and it's overall really nice. A lot of the songs are 
catchy and fun to listen to (not so much Aquaman, in my opinion). I 
definitely recommend giving it a listen before judging it. "
Awesome Love shut up and dance the most! Mt favorite song! 
"This album makes me happy! Every single song on this album is gold. PURE. GOLD! I've had this playing 
on repeat wherever I go since it was released. I've even got a couple of 
friends hooked. Keep doing what you're doing Walk the Moon! "
"I only know one song, but I love it! I know ""Shut up and Dance"" and I love it!!! "
"Amazing! I LOVE walk the moon! They are even more amazing live. Their songs are so 
good and they just make you want to dance to it and sing along! "
Love it I love shut up and dance it such an amazing song I love it. 
"Amszing Band I love this band and this album. Hearing their music make my day. It's so 
uplifting. I really love AquaMan,Shut up and dance,Portugal, and Work this 
body. "
"5 stars ♥ One of the best songs ""shut up and dance"" "
"shut up and dance love it, live it, play it get it, got it, goooood "
"Really annoying Every time I turn on my radio this song comes on. I get a major headache 
every time I hear it. If I can give this a negative rate I would. Worst 
song of 2015 so far. "
I love this song It's amazing shut up and dance 
"Brilliant. I love it. Honestly so good. I love this album so much, the songs are even better 
live. The writing & melodies are what make this a piece of art. "
"My legends of all time Brings me back memories, only if I see them in person. I'll take those 
songs back in my grave. "
"I love these guys This seriously the first album I've found where I actually like more than 
2 or 3 songs - I went from having heard shut up & dance on the radio to 
playing nothing but this album - so good! "
"I love it even though I'm 75 years old but I did here it on my grandsons 
phone he downloaded it just for me "
Love this new sound! Awesome new sound. Perfect for these times in our lives 
"There is nothing wrong and I would rate this more than 1,000% "
"Different but great It is a change from the normal M&S but it is still just as amazing as 
usual "
"This isn't a comment wat u mean, this is life I love his music, it's just so real and it's not just nonsense like some 
artists make. And in my opinion everyone should listen to him because his 
music is just perfection "
"Shawn Shawn is so cute. Never be alone reminds me of two girls, Mia Bellamy and 
Alice Foster I cry every day wishing they could love me back, especially 
Mia love u guys (don't judge. I'm gay) "
"I love you so much shawn I have always loved shawn even when he was in magcon. When i heard 
Stitches on the radio for the first time i almost cried. I am so proud of 
how far hes come!! "
"IN LOVE So I'm gonna be real. I used to not like Shawn because of vine, so I never 
really gave him a shot. Now listening to his music I have seriously fallen 
head over heels for this kid. His music just seems so real and I LOVE it. "
"Perfection at its finest Shawn's music is always perfect so I have no doubt in my mind that this 
won't be perfect. "
"He's king bae It's SHAWN MENDES why not. And the fact that he's born in toronto just 
like me makes him even more amazing "
"Wow I actually like this. I'm not a huge fan of this type of music, but this is really good and I 
may just end up buying it. "
"Amazing ❤ Shawn mendes is sooooooo amazing. I love the way he sings. His music so 
soooooo great. I never get tired of listening to it ❤ "
"Can only get better:) I love how put together the songs and album are. His voice sounds amazing 
and I really like how 'raw' and 'stripped down' the songs are.He is only 
going to grow and get better... this is just the beginning and let me tell 
ya, I feel like a proud mama. "
"I love it I love shawns music when I'm feeling sad mad or anything else even happy 
when I listen to his music it puts me in a better mood "
"Lyrics are great mixed with groovy beats. I have always loved Shawn Mendes. I love his lyrics, gets to the truth of 
the matter. He is only 16, I don't understand!?!? He is great. Look forward 
to this album and can't wait! "
"My favorite song ever in life Its such a powerful song im dealing with such a depressing time right now 
it this keeps me going :( "
"Mendes Army Forever What a great album! I have waited so long for this album, and it is 
everything I expected. My favorate songs on here are Imagination, This is 
what it Takes, Aftertaste, stitches, and A little too much. In close to 
that order. I can't just choose one, they are all so great. He is my 
absolute favorite singer, and will continue to be. I never get sick of 
listening to his songs over again. "
"It's an amazing album with relatable songs and stories in the songs and I 
absolutely love you shawn. If you reading this your incredible and 
hopefully I can see you at Taylor's tour in Tampa,Florida. My favorite song 
on the album is I don't even know your name it's beautiful and we'll 
written. I can tell you put your heart in to this album and hand wrote 
about thing you go through other people go through and I can really related 
to them. If you're think of buying shawn's album I definitely recommend it❤ "
"Love it , he has the most beautiful voice ever! OMG he is cute and has a nice voice "
"Stitches That song is so awesome and so cool all the cool words Shawn Mendes is so 
talented he is the best people in the world I love him so much "
"SHAWN, YOU ARE THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE IN A YEAR OH MA GAH HOMI YOU ARE THE BEST EVER I LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH "
"He's my life Shawn mednes is amazing. He is my life. He is the best. If you think he is 
a terrible singer you are wrong. He has a good voice and doesn't even talk 
about sex or drugs. He is so amazing. Also he wants to stop bullying and 
help other people. How could you not love him? "
"Shawn is Bae I love Shawn. I've watched him since Magcon. His music is very 
inspirational and gives me life. "
"Love you shawn I love it, a little too much is amazing. It makes me cry how big u become, 
I remember watching videos of u and the guys during Magcon , I miss that 
very much but we all have to move on right, i love you so much Shawn, u 
aren't our little secret anymore.✨ "
"The complete pop cliche collection Lyrically, this album sums up the following pop song cliches: the be who 
you are song, the stuff is happening (and it's not romantic) song, and the 
my-girlfriend-just-broke-up-with-me-so-i'll-write-a-sad-song-and-act-all-deep-and-emotional 
song. Otherwise, this album was just OK. Just another pop album by another 
guy who's name I won't remember in a month. "
"Absolutely legendary Fave.song ever, all u noobs who put it one star u r stupid so proud and 
only 17!!!!!!!!! Shaun you show amazing talent and will have a great 
future:-) :-) :-) u r awesome shaun!!!!!!! "
"Not available It isn't available in The Netherlands, but I am loving it!!!! I have every 
song since Something Big and I so proud on you!!! You are going to be 
bigger, than One Direction, serious!!! "
"If been here ever since the beginning Iv been listening watch all the music videos and his old videos I 
literally watched his first video when it came out, I stayed with him even 
though he doesn't even know Mr I stayed with him cause I knew with his 
voice he was going to make big and look at him now breaking the charts at 
#1 with his debut album Handwritten I'm so proud of him I just wish I could 
tell him in person #ShawnMendesarmy "
"I feel in love with him from the radio I heard kid in love on radio I 
didn't know what was about him I loved his voice I am still way into one 
direction but dang there is something that caught me he has the looks heart 
voice and a hole bunch of girls in love with him Shawn Mendes is going to 
be a big star in a year or two. "
"I love it I actually never liked Shawn but listening to this album to me is much 
more calming the ed "
"AWSOME The first time I heard this artist I was with my daughter, her radio 
station, OMGOSH I'm addicted to the song stitches. You have a wonderful 
voice. "
"I love him. I love Shawn so much it's not even possible. His music has helped me get 
through a lot of stuff and I am so sad and mad I can't pre order it because 
I have no money. "
"Best album ever<3 I'm such a huge fan of Shawn and his songs are so relatable and Inspiring! 
I love it and can't wait to hear the rest! Definitely recommend it to 
everyone!! (: "
"Shawn mendes is bae OMG I LUV SHAWN MEDES SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS BRON IN 
CANADA MAKES HIM EVEN BETTER LUV U SHAWN MENDE SALWAYS BE AMAZING AND 
AWESOME LUV UR SONGS "
"LOVE IT!!! Shawn mendes is AWESOME!!! I love his music and the feeling he puts into 
it!! He loves all of his fans which is AWESOME bc that means he cares. LOVE 
IT! "
"#shawnshairsquad IF IT GETS TO NUMBER 1 WE GET THE AFTERTASTE VIDEO EARLY, COME ON GUYS 5 
STARS ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ "
"Shawn is life This muffin loving harry potter fan is awesome. I love his music its not 
like any other song these days. It actually has meaning to it. Keep up the 
good work Shawn! "
"I can't wait for it! Just wondering why does it say the 24th of April if the release date has 
been moved up to the 14th of April? "
"SHAWN IS LIFE I have no words for how talented HE is, ITS LIKE A FRICKEN ANGLE MAN! "
"I knw wht u did last summer I really love tht song. I can't say it in so many words, but i just love 
it "
"Just Love It!!! He is an amazing artist. His songs hit me hard in so many ways. I really 
love his music. I love acoustics better between all the music with the loud 
beats they don't get the story across like he does. Keep writing beautiful 
music. ❤ "
".. I personally hate his songs. I'm not against him or anything but all of 
his popular songs are definitely not my style. Of course everyone has their 
own preference, but the thing I hate more about this is that radio stations 
fuckin play Stitches and other annoying songs way too frequently. I 
seriously can't stand it. I had to leave this review. Nothing against this 
guy though (so 4 star), so good luck with your music career for sure. "
"Amazeballz I love Shawn Mendes he's an amazing person and a very talented teen he is 
a very inspirational person I just love him he is perfect in every way 
there is nothing bad or imperfect about him he is just amazingly handsome 
#LoveHim "
Shawn is bae Shawn has wonderful meaningful music and I love him he's great! 
"Flawless Great album, shows his range of songs, and the beats for the songs on this 
album really stand out. Still haven't found a single song that I don't 
enjoy by Eric Church. "
"Church the chief This album is the best so far. I usually have 1 or 2 songs on his cds I 
don't like but I love every song on this album! Continue making cds like 
this! Completely in love with it. "
"Not ""Chief"", but a solid effort Outside of ""Taladega"" (which, melodically sounds eerily similar to 
""Sinners Like Me""), and ""Give Me Back My Hometown"", this album lacks the 
instant classics. But there aren't any bad songs either. They're a solid 
bunch, worthy of your money and concert ticket, just not the group of 
timeless classics that ""Chief"" produced. "
"Excellent This album is able to go back and forth from a classic country song full 
of heart to a rock song that challenges the ideals of the establishment "
"He just can't make a bad album! Just cant! & that's why I come back for 
more everytime. (: "
"Churchn' Watch out here it is album of the year! There are very few albums that 
have this many good songs! Hometown is my personal favorite song I love to 
crank it up when it comes on. Great work Eric "
"One of the all time greats, Eric Church! Ive been waiting for this album to come out for months, and it will not 
disappoint. Keep goin strong EC! "
"True artist Eric has made it known that his music is not for everyone. No, he doesn't 
follow traditional country roots and had came under fire for it. But he 
does not want to follow. This album shows how truly creative he is. He is 
original. There is no other artist out there like him. If you want 
mainstream music, please go somewhere else. But if you like a man that 
plays music for those that are outsiders and never fit in and are outcasts 
like he is, get this album and you will hear music that comes from the 
soul. "
"Exactly what I need... Seen Eric perform a week ago, bought his latest and I listen to it 
constantly. I'm loving Wrecking Ball. So sultry, seductive, sexy and full 
of masculinity. Excellent album, both lyrically and musically. Well 
written. A prelude to a tailgate, Jack and a bonfire. "
"AWESOME I'm a little upset that this album is not included in the All Access, but 
it is well worth the Buy. Eric Church never lets you down! "
"Love love love This is an awesome album to add to Eric's collection of great records. 
Getting into it took no time and there's a different component to each song 
that I love. The guitar play in Broke Record is awesome. I've already got 
my ticket to the upcoming tour and I can't wait to see him Live my 4th year 
in a row. Amazing "
Not worth the money Give me back my hometown is the best song the others suck. 
"Great album Eric Church is the best TRUE ARTIST in all of music. If you like 
cookie-cutter pop country, DO NOT buy this album and give it a bad rating 
because this isn't regular country music. Its many different genres blended 
into one album. Just buy it and listen to it. Eric is a musical genius. "
"Horrible What is Eric Church thinking ? F.Y.I. to Eric, Be yourself Dude & Create 
Some True Country Music of Your Own that's Worth Listening to ! ! ! "
"Great album! I love that Eric has said he doesn't want to make the same record twice. 
He wants every album to be unique and new, The Outsiders is a great album, 
worth every penny and make sure you listen to it in order first, there's a 
reason. Enjoy! "
"Solid album It takes listening to the songs a few times to really get them... if you 
have followed Eric Church from the beginning then you will really 
understand this album "
"SOOOO GOOOD Love this album..track #1 #7 & #11 are my total favs the only CD thats 
been playing in my car for days now! "
"Buy it today! Never a disappointment from Eric Church. Another one to put on repeat for 
days, get a case of your fav brew and crank this up! "
"Memories into words. Songs that compliment the honesty. The times we'll 
never forget. Now this is country at its finest. The rebellious, truthful, and freedom 
of putting together these melodies. "
"Country music's rebel Hats off to Eric for putting out a great record. After the success of 
Chief, it would have been very easy to go into the studio and make Chief 2. 
But that's not Church. Instead he basically said F you to the record 
company and put out the record he wanted, with new sounds and adventurous 
songs that isn't filled with #1 singles. That would have been to easy and 
so unrebel like. "
"Great album, great sound Love this album as it has songs that are clearly mainstream, but then 
others that are not at all. I'd have given it 5 stars but the Prelude on 
Devil, Devil should have come with an option to skip - spoken word is NOT 
my taste. "
"Super album! I love Eric Chruch. This album will be in heavy rotation just like the 
others. However, I am going to cancel my Google Music All Access if these 
albums aren't available on day of release. That is why I figured it was 
worth paying $9.99 per month. Guess I might as well cancel, and buy the 
album for $8 from Amazon. "
"Ok, definitely heard better Not bad for Eric church, not the greatest either.... B+ at the best, and 
that's generous. "
"Don't actually get a download of music. Be careful when buying music on Google Play. You don't actually get a 
download of the music and therefore must have a data connection to play 
music. "
"Amazing Eric Church delivered an eery indie rock/country gem with Chief and he 
delivers again with this one. Absolutely satisfied "
"Awesome Against the pop country and crying cowboy tunes Eric church excels with 
real country music. It would make Johnny and Waylon proud. "
"Changing the rules... and I love it! We know he could have easily done ""just another Chief"", but 
he didn't. He went beyond, he went creative, and he nailed it! "
"New country for sure. Gotta listen to the album at least 3 times before you judge it. He takes 
country to another level in this album especially cold one. "
"Awesome The more I listen to this album the better it gets . Guitar riffs and the 
beat of the drums really set it off. Definitely on the outside with this 
album. "
Great But does anyone know why it's not in all access? 
"This is what perfection sounds like. Every song is well thought out and wonderfully written. Flawless delivery 
and all of the Eric Church attitude we've come to love. This may be his 
best yet. "
"Awesome I know this man He actually went to my church and played in the band in my younger years. 
He is probably the greatest gospel country music artist ever "
disappointed huge E.C fan love all his previous cd's....but im not fond of this one.... 
"Perfect Every album just gets better and better. Outsiders is just something you 
can blare with the windows down, dark side really hits home with its brutal 
honesty and give me back my hometown is well.. Self explanatory. Great job 
Eric, you'll for sure make your mark in country music. Keep it up! "
Man this album tells the thruth about country I love this album cant get enough of it 
Here is a good band Need more back up Singer on there 
"Album is great thanks to NPR I can listen to it since my all access apparently is all 
limited... rather disgusted that I pay for something that has a limited 
selection. "
"Great Album Kinda different sound, but all in all I really like this album. "
Awesome!! Another great CD by Eric Church. Country/Rock is the new country. 
"Love it!!! This made my day! Hope a tour follows this release soon, can't wait to 
hear it live!!! "
"OMG I LIKE HES NUNBER #1 FAN I MEET HIM AND I CRIED LOVE HIM SO MUCH LUV U 
LUKE XOXOXO "

Cool songs 
"That bunch Wow! If you have ever really loved someone this much , you understand 
fully what she means...even to the point of causing pain to yourself just 
to have that man in your life. "
"Bomb song Yeah she knows who she is she's. The most beautiful. Girl I never. Thought 
I'd get that chance so yeah. I'm pretty great dull for her being there I 
for a lot of love for her she doesn't even know "
"Love love love LBT. Butttt... I feel like this song is pointless, stupid, and boring. It's 
just gotten to the point where it is annoying. "
GIRL CRUSH AND PAIN KILLER Excellent songs from this amazing band! Really good songs!' 
"Girl Crush Good tone, love how its interpreted wrong by so many ignorant people. Good 
song for jilted woman,by cheating man. "
"Someone's gonna come along... And rate this cd with 5 stars (not shoot you down, hehe!) Love, love, love 
LBT!!! Like all their albums before, Painkiller is full of great songs, and 
lots of hits! Awesome album right here!!! :-) "
"LBT is one of my favorite bands. They write great songs and their harmonies 
are beyond awesome. Love every song on this album "
"a whatch out i listend to this song on pandora now had nightmare about a 
woman chasing me with a bottle of lube and dildo ps just kidding its a dumb 
song just wanted to make fun of it HAHA 
SSSSSSSTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPIIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDDDDSSSSSOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG "
"""Girl Crush"" When I first heard this song... I felt like somebody reached deep into my soul and put some old feelings 
for someone to music. Just blew be away! Then that caused me to do some 
serious ""Day Drinking"". That was my ""Pain Killer"". I luv you guys LBT! "
"Awesome! I love LBT and this album is absolutely amazing! You will only be 
disappointed if you don't get it NOW!!! "
"Boring...just boring -_- Two words: BORING, DULL!!!! What is the big deal? This only makes me wanna 
fall asleep.-_- "
"Simply Awesome I've been listening to this album nonstop for days and it just keeps 
getting better. Not a carbon copy of the equally amazing Tornado, and still 
great. I see many chart topping singles in LBTs future! "
"Girl crush is really really good. I just cant stop hearing it I have it on 
my ring tone "
"Pain Killer- Little Big Town Awesome, Sizzling, Sexy,just a great album "
"Amazing I've said the same as the lyrics (girl crush) not but a couple of years 
ago crazy "
"GIRL CRUSH must have been written for me -except it brings tears to my eyes when I 
hear it cause I was jilted by my x husband (with the help of his sister who 
pushed her best friend on him since we were together) "
"I love little big town, I try to play it on my phone but it takes about 30 
minutes to hear it. But to me it's worth it. Girl Crush if u haven't heard 
it then u should "
"Little Big Town Saw em twice in michigan....y""all are awesome "
"Album of the year Every song on this album is spectacular and they will be winning a lot of 
awards for this I'm sure. "
"Girl crush Dumbest song ever. How are you going to become obsessed with a female your 
man left you for? Good Bye with that nonsense! You need to love yourself 
and be you! If he likes her oh well on to the next. Not trying to die being 
like her so he can come back to you!! A guy who is worth your time wouldn't 
put you through this!! "
"pain killer Girl Crush is my Favorite but ALL THE SONG S Are GREAT! Little Big Town, Is my favorite group! Have been since they 
came ,or released their 1st album. "
"Awesome! Girl Crush: You might have to look up the lyrics if you believe it's 
something other than what it really is. She's singing about the girl she 
wants to be like, so that the guy will want her instead. "
"Beautiful voice If you think this is a ""gay song"", you are part of the problem. A 
beautiful song about a girl who wants her man back. "
"Girl crush Seems like the way I can do it for the first place and the other day and I 
will be able to get the chance to get the chance to talk to him and he is a 
good time to get the same as the most important thing is that the best way 
to go "
Pain Killer If you don't like this album then your not country. 
"Day drinking. I am going to have a good time and consideration of my resume for you to 
know if I can be reached by phone and then I can do to help with the 
following link below to unsubscribe from my mobile phone number of the

Little BigTown Girl crush.....IS MY FAVORITE...BUT I LOVE ALL THEIR SONGS 
Loved it I love the song girl crush it is a good song. Love how they sing it 
Girl Crush I'll have you back believe that. I LOVE YOU FOREVER 
"Love Little Big Town I would not consider myself a country music fan, I would call say I am a 
music fan and this is a wonderful band. Love this album and their first 
album. Great band. "
Its ok They could do better considering girl crush is on this album. 
"Girl Crush Haven't heard good music in a while. I'm Puerto Rican, and I love all 
genres. But because of this song and many others , I'm headed towards 
country and folk to be my favorite!! #thanksforsuchanamazingsong "
"Little Big Town Is My ""Painkiller"" All great songs!!!... Girl Crush is by far my favorite!! However, the 
songs each have their own unique melody and I find myself singing all of 
them, all the time! Definitely a group that will become near and dear to my 
heart.❤ "
Amazing people who say that girl crush sucks y`all are nuts 
"Little Big Town rocks this album!!! Love that LBT put some more rock into these songs! Also love that Kimberly 
has more solo parts! Powerhouse vocals by these group. No group like 
them!!! "
Girl crush I got a girl crush so catchy ad good 
"My favorite band in te world. Little big town is the only band I listen to 
no matter what people say about them. "
Yasss!!! Love it! And the meaning behind this song is so lovely and sad♡ 
"Brings out the inner red neck. I grew up with classic, arena rock hair bands and such do not like a lot 
of country but after born and raised in the boon docks I have been a big 
fan, I love day drinking, and the women are as beautiful as their voices. "
Love girl crush Best song she could ever sing 
"Good song Real strong voice well, Sia has an amazing voice anyway so theres nothing 
new about that. In this song there is a lot of meaning and it makes the 
hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The reason why I dont love the 
song is because of the music video. If you don't know what I'm on about 
check it out............. "
"Sia's BACK and Bigger Than Ever! I've been a big fan of Sia since ""Breathe Me"", and with the success of her 
songwriting career, I was beginning to 'fear' she'd never make another solo 
album, but boy did she surprise me. Sia has come back in full force with 
1000 Forms of Fear, and in the process has captured the attention of a 
newer, much broader audience. "
"AWESOME!!!! I love every song on Sia's new album! My favorites are: Chandelier, Fire 
meet gasoline, Free the animal, Burn the pages, Big girls cry, and Elastic 
heart. "
"1000 Forms Of Addiction Chandelier has easily become my favorite song. I find myself humming and 
dancing to it even in very public places! The music video (viewable in the 
official music video on YouTube) is equally beautiful. I crave more music 
like this, and I think everybody should give this song a listen to. "
"Love it. This album is amazing. To me it is like 1000 Forms of Feels. Been 
listening to Sia everywhere i can, on my phone, on the laptop, on my xbox, 
and if i have to i'll steal my friends phone to listen to Sia if i have to. "
"Amazing Despite not showing her face during performances it's her music we like. 
Can't see her face on the radio can you? Brilliant album as such and 
Elastic Heart is my song of this year. "
"AMAZING burn the pages, chandelier, elastic heart, big girls cry, fire meet 
gasoline ... All amazing tracks "
"AMAZING!! Can't stop listening and absolutely amazing. Her music is just different 
from others and it changes your mind on things. Love how she describes the 
struggles out there with creatives ways. What an amazing woman! "
"Sia 1000 forms of fear Amazing job Sia love every song my 2 favorites are elastic heart and 
chandelier "
"Beautiful voice, great lyrics, good beats A lot of very well rounded songs! "
"OMG I am completely shell shocked on how amazing every bit of her songs are. 
Maddie in chandelier was phenomonal and im almost speechless on how Sia 
changed how I feel about music forever. "
Love it Beautiful song and the choreography of the video is amazing. Well done sia 
I LOVE SIA! Her album is amazing and I love her music! She's very inspirational 
"Because it's beautiful I was so moved by the video everyone is afraid of that I felt compelled to 
support this unquestionable musical and artistic accomplishment. "
"She's an amazing singer and writer People don't realize how many famous songs she's written and to sing like 
this.. she has True talent "
"Incredible & Astonishing ! I don't care what anyone has to say, but SIA is very AMAZING !! Her voice 
draws me into this state of mind where everything is fine and calm. Her 
music is very mind drawn and I just love it. "
"CHANDELIER I really do like this song !!!! She has a powerful singing voice that not 
everyone singing has and it holds me captive when ever I hear the song 
...ha It's something about saying CHANDELIER that I way I find cool... "
"Awsome! What's not to love about SIA!!! Awsome singer & super talented song 
writer. Has done Adelaide, South Australia very proud. ☺ "
"I have a 1TB hard drive on my personal computer which I'm sure you can 
appreciate is a huge amount. However, despite this enormity of storage 
capacity, I see this album as a waste of that plentiful storage space. Tom 
Blaser - Editor in Chief at T'n'T "
"Sia 1000 forms of fear Have to say until my wife pointed out Sia singing with her back to the 
audience I'd never heard of her or realised she had wrote so many songs for 
major artists, this album is great not one bad song Sia tears it up and her 
vocal skills are second to none well worth buying! "
"Great voice, love the sounds! Amazing album to relax to. Walking dogs, big fields, good music....lost in 
thought!!! Love it! "
"Sia is epic! Keep it going Sia. I absolutely love your songs. They have so much soul 
and I can really feel your pain and emotions. I love the fact that there is 
this deep powerful undertone in your voice. It really gives a powerful 
element to the music. Thank you for your music and never give up in life x "
"Sia is the most talented artist I know. She has helped me overcome my fear 
and break free of all my guilt Chandelier is the most unique name ever for 
a song and its new, fresh, and amazing "
"Amazing talent Sia definitely found the perfect match when she found Maddie Ziegler. They 
both have amazing talent. Never saw a twelve year old with such talent. And 
Sia by far is one of the most talented Artist. Not only an extraordinary 
voice, but also a fantastic song writer. Watching their videos never gets 
old. My five year old daughter tries to do the ""Chandelier"" dance.. it's 
priceless. "
"Absolutely amazing! The best album yet by this fantastic artist! You're amazing Sia! Hugs from 
a fellow songwriter! ♡ "
"Amazing SIA has an amazing voice. Elastic heart fits with anyone who loves with 
there heart in a cool artistic sound of today or beyond. Everyone has there 
own music taste. She fits in to my eclectic music genre. "
"I love Sia. Her music is so raw and conveys real emotion and pure talent. 
Her songs write out like thoughts that I've had at one point or another in 
life and that I just didn't have the words to express. She paints with her 
music, and she knows how to make her songs catchy to pretty much anyone who 
hears it and who has an ear for good music. 5 stars all the way, she is my 
favorite artist. "
"1000 Forms Of Fear This bus an outstanding comeback from Sia. Her vocals throughout the 
record are absolutely incredible. She is an outstanding lyricist and create 
soulful lyrics sparking thought and emotion. Some great songs are 
CHANDELIER, BIG GIRLS CRY, FREE THE ANIMAL and DRESSED IN BLACK. But if you 
really want good sound quality, (well, who doesn't?) then support your 
local record shop by purchasing the CD or the Vinyl. Because they are 
always superior to digital in every way. Plus you get lyrics and artwork! "
1000 forms of fear Yet another fantastic sia album..upbeat ...and impressive. Love it 
"you are amazing no matter what me personally I am your biggest biggest biggest fan I love your whole 
album especially chandelier I listen to the song everyday and I cry cry cry 
you are so powerful I wish I could meet you but a thousand forms of fear 
was your best album ever. you are the best artist I feel like I'm going to 
cry SIA I bought your album you're all over my room. Your pictures my 
background girl I just love love love you keep swinging from the chandelier 
I'm trying to learn the whole dance but very very good song I luv ur CD "
"1000 Forms of Fear Realised An album for deep thinkers and the displaced. Also for the happy, the 
quirky and those that love genuine melodies. If your background is heavily 
sheltered you may love the music more than the videos. An uplifting 
near-perfect pop album. Sia's gift for pop writing is lovingly matched with 
her out-of-this-world voice, but unmatched by her peers, and this album 
shines new light on her talents - it features songs that no one else 
wanted, and (probably causing the first point) tracks too personal or too 
unsingable for anyone else as Sia reaches heights with her voice I didn't 
know existed. Dark corners and bright guiding lights throughout. Oh, if you 
wind up imagining your head in a blonde wig flinging yourself round the 
house it's ok, it's totally totally ok. "
"A true artist, much beauty and creativity. Beautiful album, truly beautiful. This album has so much creativity and so 
much emotions; Sia has great vocals in the track and it's easy to tell that 
this album is truly a masterpiece. It's been a long time since this album 
has been sold for the first time yet this album still remains to amaze me. 
Sia's song writing is truly phenomenal. I believe Sia will become a legend 
as a artist, her use of language, the use of emotive cracks and her use of 
art forms truly shows that she will be remembered. "
"Sia is an amazing artist and 1000 Forms of Fear is proof! Sia’s 1000 Forms of Fear is stunning! Each track on the album evokes a 
different emotion. Excitement, sadness, hope, and of course fear. This is 
without a doubt the best album of the year! "
"An Unexpected Crush Sought this record out after falling in love with 'Elastic Heart'. Sia is 
an amazing woman, with a lot of heart and talent. Every single track is 
beautiful! I listen from the beginning, straight through the end. Best 
purchase I've made in a long time! "
"I love it. I love her and her music. Shes amazing! I love chandelier and that little 
girl. OMG!!! "
"Sia: 1000 forms of fear One of my favorite new artists I highly recommend this album for anyone 
who needs to escape.... "
"Amazing Sia is an amazing artist and song writer I didn't know she wrote diamonds 
for rihanana lol... But I will say she needs to.get over whatever she has 
and start performing more .... For the longest I.thought the little girl 
for the video was her... Hands down a great artist amazing vocalist love 
all.her songs on this album "
"Amazing! Sia has one of the best ranges in the entire world and she definitely 
connects with her fans in this album. 1000 Forms Of Fear is an album that 
makes you just sit down and close your eyes and actually listen to all of 
the lyrics to hear her story. Definitely one of the best albums of 2014 so 
far. "
"Sia I love chandelier, I love sia! She has inspired me to be whatever I want 
to be!! Did u know that the dancer in the music video is Maddie Ziegler 
from dance moms?!?! Oh she wears a wig and a bodysock thing!! Both my 
friends and I listen to this song over and over!! "
"I can say i truely admire her... Sia has a story behind every song and not to mention, she wrote them which 
is hard to say about artists these days. Not only are her songs a work of 
art, but she is. Im so proud of her overcoming her past and what she has 
dealt with. She is strong and she will face those 1000 forms of fears with 
her elastic heart. This is a masterpiece. One of the greatest vocal 
melodies! "
"Lover of his songs Love the album the songs that I love the most is jealous,chains,and 
teacher. It's something new and different from when he was with his 
brother's. You never knew that he will go this far in music. His music is 
unique "
"Like it It was cool! There where a couple songs I didn't really like, like teacher 
and other ones "
"Love it I think he looks cute. He has a great voice. He was on well the for kids 
choice awards Sing a song for me!!!!!!!! I like the song jealous "
"I love the whole album I love chains Jealous & teacher i love the r&b touch of his music i do 
agree With the person Who said he needs to reup with usher they would sound 
amazing Together "
"AWESOME SONGS!!! I absolutely love his voice! My number one favorite is ""Chains"" and my 
number two favorite is ""Jealous"". WAY TO GO, NICK!!! "
"Its not that great. He is a good singer, but I like more r&b this is more 
pop taylor swift stuff. He needs to get with usher so usher can put some 
r&b in it. I think he would go alot further if he got someone like usher to 
produce. "
"One of the best albums of 2014. Despite a mix of uptempo tracks to serve as 
the singles ('Jealous', 'Teacher' & 'Chains'), the album is actually 
primarily composed on atmospheric R&B slow-jams. Solid from star to finish. "
"Uh... I don't really see the special thing everyone sees about Nick, he's not 
even talented. I tried to like this but just no... "
"Nick Jonas jealous Shout out to Nick man I love this song can you continue like making songs 
like this like with the beat the harmonizing and just the way it sounds I 
love this song like really I'm a singer myself I'm in intermediate choir 
chorus at Opelousas Senior High in Louisiana and I did this song as a solo 
and everybody loved it so yeah Nick please do more songs like this really 
appreciate it I am one of your fans keep it I am truly inspired keep up the 
good work bro!!! "
"I like to listen to all of nick Jonas songs are very wonderful and awesome 
rapper and he is really sexy and handsome rapper and he is very talented 
and awesome rapper and he is more sexy and handsome rapper better than his 
brother anyway too. I like to listen to all of nick Jonas songs are very wonderful and awesome 
rapper and he is really sexy and handsome rapper and he is very talented

enjoy your life in new York City I hope you play halo on Xbox 360 and Xbox 
live hope you will have a family one day "
"A cross over for sweet Jonas The symphonic melodies, the falsetto notes, the love ballad, this is an 
attraction for old and new generations! "
"Amazing! Ever since I watched The Jonas Brothers on Disney Channel I have wanted 
Nick to go solo and let me just say..WOW. This is better than I ever 
expected. He has really broke away from Disney in the right way! There are 
fast songs and slow, sappy songs on this album. All the right kinds :) "
"♡♡Just amazing.♡♡ ♡♡I've been a fan of his since he started with his brothers. Still to this 
day I love all of them. Not just Nick, not just Joe, or not just Kevin, 
even Frankie is awesome, got off track nut anywho. Love you Nick Jonas, 
keep up the great work.♡♡ I love how you have grown into such an amazing 
man. I love the RnB style goes great with you, yet everything else

"Absolutely love it Nick, I'd never thought I'd fall in love with a Jonas brother.... but it 
happened. Thank you. "
"Fantastic experience listening to this. Great album with well chosen features. Joe Jonas has that soft voice with 
powerful words behind it to which all can relate especially men such as 
myself. Excellent Joe Jonas, just pure class!! "
"Great solo album This is very well produced and nick has strong vocals. Key tracks are 
""nothing would be better"", ""push"", ""wilderness"" and ""jealous"". "
"Have you ever heard jealous remix omg who ever did that had there glasses 
on to tight;) has the f word and everybody wants you sex i mean that is 
horrible he was a nickloadian and i have no clue how to spell that but 
realy thats like bad "
"He is so hot I know what I'm talking bout he is the best chains is the most 
awesomest song ever "
"Im honestly so excited! This is the time in his music where It's all him 
and It's been in hiding. The sound of the album is going to be amazing. "
"Wow His voice is amazing. I love how he changed it. More rnb pop than what he 
did with his brothers. I think he needed this. Of course I love the song 
with Demi. They just work really well together. "
"Nick Jonaus I nick jonaus because he's cute and awsome and jelous and chains is my 
best song "
"He is amazing Nick Jonas is the cutiest guy in the world I wish I could meet him in 
person it would be a dream come true "
"I LOVE this album I love this album. Especially Chains, Numb, Nothing Would Be Better "
You got me in chains for this song He made the right choice leaving his brothers I think he better this way 
"Chains 2015 all about Love , while we watch , wait, wonder,can Love survive 
despite recession "
Lover him crushing Lol I love his song im in love my peeps lol♥♥♥♥♥●●● 
I love this YOU GOT ME IN CHAINS FOR YOUR LOVE AND I wouldn't CHANGE THIS LOVE 
"Love him My aunt actually taught the Jonas brothers gymnastics when they were 
kids!!! "
"IN LOVE WITH THIS ALBUM Funky, dancy, and sexy is the best kind of music right? "
"Alright To much auto tune I don't consider this rap without his beats he's crap 
when actually can flow some lyrics then I can actually listen where is the 
old future "
"Future Done Finally Found his Sound! You can see the Growth from Pluto to honest..and the growth going on to 
the last 3 mixtapes he dropped monster, beastmode, 56 nights..DS2 just 
solidified that sound!! ..This Album Got the Trap Boomin in Traps all over 
the states "
"HOW CAN U NOT LIKE IT future specifically said that this album was not tenichally made the way 
he wanted,BUT LOOK HOW AWESOME THIS ALBUM IS.We have thought it was a 
drought, where ya at,stick talk,freak hoes,slave master,blow a bag any 
other bangers that I definitely did not see coming... Future gonna be 
bangin with this one album for a minute #FBG "
"I dont know Its not a bad album, definitely not as bad as Cherry Bomb but it cant get 
much worse. Anyway most track on this album are quite monotonous and you 
will get tired of them quickly. Future is quite average rapper I bet he 
cant freestyle because lyrically he's just weak, you cant put him in the 
same line with Tech N9ne or Kendrick Lamar. However I dont mind listening 
to this album, because like I said its not a bad album but its also nothing 
special. "
"DS2 Future killin the streets right now ya feel me been a fan of his but he 
went in on every song "
"Rap Album of the Year? No just album of the Year This project has no flaws. It's pure clear VS1 Clarity. The intro, thought 
it was a drought, brought us the great line about gucci flip flops and it 
sys the tone for the test of the album. His only feature on the album, 
Where Ya At with Drake, should be a song that is constantly played on the 
radio. Musical production on this is superb. No one beat out shines the 
other. He thankfully includes his hits from his 56 nights, Beast Mode and 
Monster project which just strengthen the project more. 10/10 "
"THATS FUTURES REAL VOICE NOT AUTO TUNE if u listen to his regular voice 
then u would know that but poppin a** albumn and u can't put him in those 
rap categories cause he does both singing and rap. DIRTY SPRITE 2!!!!!!! "
"Future True rapper, nice beat,best bars,always fresh. There is nothing to hate 
about this man.his is the best. "
"To think I didn't like future when he first came out. Hands down my 
favorite rapper out right now. From a person who just loves the music I 
seen your progression from day 1 to now. #Beast #FBG #Finesse "
"Retarded album. All you ""rappers"" do is throw on a dope beat and say freaking nonsense and 
just auto tune it. Seriously, where's the good hip hop "
"Trash This is terrible, how can anyone stand this garbage? Its sad that this is 
the type of rap that gets radio play. Try listing to Chris Webby, John 
Connor, Stevie Stone, ¡Mayday!, slaughterhouse, Futuristic, Yelawolf, they 
have lyrical content, stories to tell and actually make since. This guys is 
just awful, quit making bad rappers famous. "
"...DEAD This is not hip hop. But do I expect an album from future to be real hip 
hop? NOT AT ALL lol! I respect his style and approach but calling him a 
rapper is highly laughable and ludicrous. When I Play real hip hop, expect 
the love of the hip hop game! Meaning, powerful lyrics, delivery, 
meaningful words, ability to change up flow, style, and wordplay, 
metaphors, and know how to MC. Move the crowd with a great performance. 
Everyone has there opinion but certain things are facts certain things are 
opinions. Tos "
"Lit The transition from each track is really good. Even if you find a song you 
are not too interested in (for w.e. reason ) then future makes it that you 
can keep listening regardless. He went back in with this album, definitely 
stepped it up from the original dirty sprite. "
"Overrated Where are all the people that still know music? This definitely isn't 
album of the day week month nor year. Y'all like it bc everybody else that 
y'all think is cool likes it, mainly trap niggaz n wannabe trap niggaz. I 
like Future but he's overrated. "
"it's ok just get confused he is Vista's baby daddy I think.I mean that's 
all I know this rapper as. c I a r a ' s ex "
"His music is boring So this is what hip hop has come down to? It's boring n he sounds bored 
singing/rapping it. N the auto tune is old already. His lyrics are not very 
good. I just can't seem to enjoy his music. As a featured artist he's ok 
but an entire album of him is way too much. 2 stars is being generous "
"Hated Bugatii But Trap, Know the meaning n the Strippers joint tho..The Deluxe song made 
me an official fan.. "
"Album of the Year candidate I haven't anticipate an album this much since Makaveli's 7 Day Theory: The 
Don Killuminati. I have 0 doubts that Fire Marshal Future, Super Future, 
Future Vandross, Future Hendrix will shut down the Rap Game on July 17th! 
A1FBG! Chiraq to ATL. "
"Great!!!! I have not bought an album since j cole's 2014 Forest Hills Drive. I 
definitely bought this one no question. Future is my favorite artist 
because he is creative. Hopefully this sells like it should. "
"What the fluff This album is the definition of what rap is today.This dude is hardly 
spittin.It sounds hecka dope because of the beat.But the verses are 
straight wack. Hopsin on his new album pound syndrome a skit called ""No 
Words"" this exactly what he was talking about.People will say something is 
dope because of the beat and the autot tune sounds good but it's not 
rap.its wack.sorry future gave you a chance and this sucked. "
"DS2 Already know dis finna B album of the year frfr God Blessing all the Fat 
niggas "
"The Best Rap Album Drake and Future are the only two albums i could listen to without 
skipping through the whole playlist "
"Future definitely made a name for himself this year boy I tell you. People 
who didn't even know future know his name now, who else you know drop 3 
fire mixtapes and still give you a classic album #MyNigga "
"My heart is like in love This song is amazing the fact that there are people in the world who don't 
like must not know what music really is I really HOPE that they make more 
songs like this one of the best songs I ever heard in my whole entire life "
"Album on Fire!!! Future. is my favorite rapper. Metro boomin,sonny digital, tm88 808 
mafia,Southside 808 mafia,and zaytoven making fresh. beats keep it up yall. 
on fire "
"Gonna be DOPE I have all futures albums and mixtapes and this DS2 is going to be just 
what i need to get my year right #futurehive "
"#FUTUREHIVE I really love the album; I practically have the songs memorized now! Good 
work Future! "
Nun but luv I def think he on his ish. I rock wit dis 1. Def keep it up 
"Definitive Album of Future's career. Easily his best album released to date, sonically outstanding and he 
handled himself well through the whole album using only one feature. If you 
didn't believe future could carry a full solo LP on his own then let this 
project convince you. "
"After dropping those three mixtapes for free I had to support a lot of 
artists do not drop free music. I got the deluxe album $12.99 I love it. To 
all you critics this music is for trap this is not for inspirational 
content so knock it off. if you don't like what you're hearing turn it off 
we don't need to hear your comments about futures album. this is trap rap "
"Future Hendrix ! Best to ever do it . after my nikka Gucci , BUR #FREEGUWOP "
"Lazy Rapper Another stupid Rap album about money and strippers.. I will always be a 
Fan of Hip Hop, but this is just another example of how beats and accent 
can get you money. It's sad.. "
"Why is explicit album edited?!? I brought the album yesterday from here and even though I paid for the 
explicit version every song expect for like 1 is edited. The album is nice 
but just doesn't sound right edited. Can someone please help me or 
reimburse me.. this isn't what I paid for "
"Future He has no lyrics, only thing good about his music is the production. "
"Back to the (old) FUTURE !!! You can never go wrong with this album. He created a true masterpiece, 
locally and globally! "
I love future trap song BRUSH UR TEETH CRAB U STUF LOL AHAHAHHA 
"Fewtch gave us 3 complete bodies of work for free. Had to pay for this one to 
show appreciation. #futurehive "
"Love It Very good album nice hooks not too deep his songs has some has deep 
meaning and very good lyrics I can relate to the music Good Job Future 
Freeband Gang going places "
"Best album out right now Future did his thing on this one all of them hit singles most def. Love it 
gonna be bumping this one for a while ;) "
