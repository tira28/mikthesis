"In the lonely hour Words fail me.I lost my husband recently and he's tunes although 
tearjerkers are beautiful and are helping me grieve "
"In the lonely hours His voice so beautiful I can not wait till next CD comes out love him sexy 
voice "
"Amazing voice, amazing album! Utterly superb! One of the most outstanding male vocalists sings some of 
the best songs heard in years. Prepare to be moved. "
"When I' It's Time To Say Goodbye. . When Tts Time To Say Goodbye ..It'd The 
Hardest Fall Of All! Memories Gather Like A Huge Rodeo...I't Takes A Part 
Of Your Very Soul...You Wonder Lord Am I Doing The ( Right Thing)?....I

"Stay with me Absolutely loved it so very amazing coming from an artist with an talented 
n amazing voice n looking forward to hearing all da songs "
"Best Love him, love his music! Amazing person! Lovely voice! Best ever!! "
Love it! This is a great album Sam's voice so smooth and soulful! 
"Don't get me wrong. Don't get me wrong or anything, but its a great album, it suits Sam a lot, 
I don't think people should be complaining that 'Oh his songs are too sad' 
and stuff, so like why don't you just listen to other songs rather than 
this? 'Oh because my fingers will get sore from pressing a SINGLE button!' 
Anyway, SAM YOU ARE MY NUMBER# 1 FAVOURITE MALE ARTIST!!!!! "
Beautiful! Love Sam he's awesome he's got such a beautiful voice love is love♡ 
"The Male Adele. I've seen him live and it was TRULY worth waiting in line for two hours 
and $20. This album was absolutely fantastic. Drink wine and prepare to 
cry. "
"Love I absolutely love this album it helps me out with break ups and just going 
through rough times !! GREAT "
"POWERFUL Sam Smith is a young old soul singing from a depth of his being he appears 
to young to have experienced. Hearing ""Stay With Me"" drove me to the play 
store. His unique voice satisfies my soul.He does not sound like anyone 
else. "
"Phenomenal album! I personally love this album because it reminds me of the good old days. 
I'm also very blown away by Sam's voice!!! "
"I can't believe it He writes some amazing music but I found out that he was gay wow who would 
of guessed if you don't believe look it up and that song stay with me was 
meant for a guys and I'm not hating on him he writes some good music "
"Perfect Sam is the only guy who I hear .. I know sad. Sam is very succeful and to 
prove it he won 4 grammys!! The album means that he's lonely although he 
started to come out his shell as he was writing his songs. I think his best 
songs are : Like I can, Money On my mind, Ley me down, Stay with me , I'm 
not the only one, lalala (ft) disclosure (ft), restart and more .. I just 
forgot their names... anways .. Sam is an awesome person... U know if he 
wasn't gay I would've kissed him... but that's okay. I love You Sam "
"LOVE SAM SMITH I love Sam Smith so much he has such an incredible voice and his song 
comes from the soul and he sings the truth unlike other musicians right 
now. "
"Frankly Excited. When I first heard about this Artist I thought he was a One hit Wonder. 
But he has potential. I like the songs Like I can and I'm not the only one. "
"Superb Wonderful, not only for a debut, but also just an amazing album in the 
first place. "
"I have heard better I'm not trying to be rude or anything I love some of his songs but some of 
them I love and some of them are sad but I rated it as liked it and I do 
like it "
"Fire! If anyone thinks this a joke get your head examined. OvO is taking over 
the only other camp that matters is Black Hippies aka Kdot and crew 
everyone else is an after thought. Tales from the 6 is going to wreck 
careers watch and sit back and take notes on greatness. "
"In my personal opinion, this mixtape is fire. People need to remember these 
are throwaway tracks from Views From The 6 though. Wait till the actual 
album! "
"Way up. And it's only a mixtape and it goes, way hard. Drake might realeased this 
only to get off Cash Money records but it's pretty good. Can't wait to see 
the actual album though. There are songs that are way up and some that are 
less way up, but overall this thing is poppin'. "
"Drake will be a legend one day I gotta say that Drake is beast when it comes to dropping tracks on his 
hometown of Torono... one day this guy will be a legend no doubt "
"Drake Fan I've been fan of drake for a while every since he joined young money. 
Shouts out to Wayne, hope you get your record label fixed. And by fixed i 
mean claim it as yours, cuz it was rightfully yours in the first place. 
Anyways drake did amazing on the new album and hope there are more great 
ones to come #longliveOVO "
"6God beast! Definitely great work! It isn't even an album and it sounds like one 
worked on for a decade! "
"Mix tape is so hot! Mannn I had to keep my phone in the freezer just to 
keep my phone from burning up! "
"OVO Energy ⚡ This mixtape (Album) is pure gold I change from song to song and it's just 
quality. My favorite is energy.The meaning and lyrical content is intense I 
am really feeling this sh!t. I'm glad he realesed this as his forth record 
of the cash money deal done and it means he can now do exactly what he want 
with next album which is gonna blow the rap game out of the water. If this 
mixtape hasnt already woke them up. "
"Overhyped Some amazing singles. Drake lyrics are more confident but it definitely a 
step back from his previous albums. "
"Wednesday Night Introduce (Explicit) ft. PARTYNEXTDOOR Legend ft. Travis 
Scott Back To Back Energy Hotline Bling Company Man ft. Travis Scott Used To ft. Lil Wayne Pop Style ft. The 
Throne Intro (Explicit) Jungle ft. Travis Scott Drake If You're Reading 
This It To Late Strong Language is Listen to CD Player "
"Omg... He absolutely destroyed this! Some of the greatest lyrics that I have ever 
heard on top of some nice beats. It's so dark and you can tell he's angry 
and fed up like you can literally feel the emotion. I think every year 
Drake gets better! I guess this is what he meant when he said he already 
has spring 2015 poppin. "
"real hiphop anyone who thinks that this trash is real hiphop needs their ears 
examined, all these syrupy lame hooks, wack lyrics, terrible. the only 
reason i gave it one star is because it makes you do it to submit the 
review. if u wanna hear real hiphop check out Logic, he is WAAAAY better 
than Drake. "
"I don't know... His bars were dope, but I was just not feeling the production. I would 
usually find one or two songs that I would immediately like on his albums, 
but it's hard for me to achieve that in this. Maybe his next album that's 
set out for the summer? "
"Not sure why this is so popular Drake really dropped the ball on this album, it sounds and looks like a 
mixtape with mostly throwaway tracks, but of course the production was 
great. Sadly, the lyrics are more bland than usual and never really reach 
some of his earlier work. It seems like Drake is not really interested in 
dropping a great verse, and is trying to take the Migos route. I wish this 
was better, but out of all major artist to drop an album this year this 
album is the most disappointing. I'll stick with Take Care for now. "
"Worst drake yet! Sick of 0-100 drake that has no depth or lyricism, i want Take Care drake 
that was actual fire!""through the 6 with my woes""trash lyrics "
"This album is sick. Loves how he changes the beats on some of the songs 
such as know yourself. Love 6pm in New York. Overall great album. "
"2 stars because I could only find 2 decent tracks on this album. Bring the 
old drake back. ""The Drake from 4 years ago"" "
"Work the night shift Awesome mixtape... Defiantly was a hype mixtape, he's pretty cocky on the 
album but I'm able to vibe to every song "

"Love this Mix tape! I can't stop listening to all of these tracks!... There's a story behind 
every single one of these tracks... There's going to be a Tupac & Biggie 
type of situation sometime soon... Just let that sink in.. "
"Keep it going drizzy He snapped on this album it reminds me of the old drake before he signed 
with cash money and too the kid that said he been a drake fan ever since he 
got with cash money u not a real drizzy fan until you heard his old stuff 
before he signed with Wayne.....smh... "
"Throwaway tracks Drake always releases songs that are hits after hits but with this 
mixtape/album it was a low for him but I've been reading that its just 
throwaway songs from his upcoming album. "
"Drake will never be real hip hop or r&b I listen to all drakes albums to see what the hype is all about but all I 
get is another let down to autotune singing, terrible rhyming, and beats 
that are just unsatisfying I feel we all need to stop looking at the charts 
and all the money a find someone you can let your heart do the feeling not 
your brain. R&b artist I suggest andre 3000, usher, neyo, Chris Brown, 
Rihanna and the weekend "
"If you're barely dl it's too late Great album considering I never was a drake fan this project really shows 
his talent to the fullest. Beat production and lyricism are on point. "
"What is with the cover? The songs are deep af, but seriously, why does the album cover look like a 
chik-fil-a cow's suicide note? "
"Album is fire...but there's like one or two song that were not so good but 
other than that it's badass...... its worth it "
"Upgrade Can I please upgrade to explicit. I didn't know they had a explicit 
version and I purchased the regular album can I please upgrade. I'll give 
it 5 stars if you help "
"Do right and kill everything DRAKE Drake put his words to use, people need to close their eyes and just 
listen to this man put it all out there "
"These are throwaway tracks Views from the 6 should be fire if these are leftovers. Would be 5 stars 
if ""6 god"" was new but its been on SoundCloud for a couple months now. "
"Ok lets talk about 6 God. If you dont know what it means its giving praise 
to Satan the 6 god 666. His praying hands with a 6 is also a symbol used to 
show your alliance with the beast. He definitely sold his soul like the 
rest of cash money. Drake is talented dont get me wrong but he is a devil 
pusher. "
"Not his best work This album is still good but definitely not up to par with drake's 
previous albums so if you haven't gotten his other albums yet then get 
those first "
"Beast Drake isn't one of the realist people but you can't deny that he makes 
some really dope music "
"Songs catchy but verses are wacky Seriously Drake really needs to start rapping.this album is really 
energetic and catchy.but rap is more than what this. It's very 
disappointing that rap has come this. ""Running through the six with my 
woes"" c'mon now. I loved that ""Comeback seson"" drake not this.But if you 
like catchy hooks and wack bars get this album. "
"Great last YMCMB Great I can't wait until him and lil wayne roast birdman and young thug 
hahaha "
"Don't forget it's a mixtape not an album U people need to remember that these are the songs he said weren't good 
enough to be on views from the 6 and people are still saying how amazing it 
is if u want to talk about overhype all I have to say is ""to pimp a 
butterfly"" i love my boy kendrick and i know u guys are gonna say ""oh well 
he actually had a message to his music"" and thats great but the production 
wasn't that good drake's mixtape was way better "
"Drake is no longer my idol! I like listening to music from an artist whose emotions I believe are 
sincere. Now the truth about Drake comes out, I no longer believe in Drake. 
Manna kiss was pre-planned and he begged Madonna to kiss him. When she did, 
he acted surprised and immature! All the Drake Haterz have been right all 
this years; what a fake! Have deleted all Drake songs from my collection. "
Fire Drake is a beast he has me turned up or thinking bout life 
"Crap as always. With his 2nd grade punchlines. And all these youngins gassed up, thinking 
this is great rap/hip hop. Straight garbage. Spitting bars and sounding 
soft as roman noodles. As long as he keeps up with catchy kindergarden 
lines, these high school kids think this is hard. Joke. Someone needs to 
revive this rap game. "
"Best Work in Awhile I didn't always like Drake but for a few songs. This Album he killed 
almost every song. I only didn't like 2 or 3. "
"the 2nd best album of all of drakes album take care is the best and. I love 
drake but using the word woe is satanic and of the devil this is the only 
thing. I dislike about the album but other than that drakes the all time 
best "
"+Steven Schiebe, just shut up. Its only not original if its the same song. 
And FYI,it sounds NOTHING like Nicki Minaj's Super Bass. "
"Amazing This is such a good album. I bought it with the funds on my google rewards 
account and it really was worth it! I love it so much! And you can download 
the album and put it on your iPod which I didn't know about. "
"It would s so cool This really cool because we get listen to Megan Trainor's songs and it is 
really amazing now it don't have to go to YouTube to listen to her songs 
amazing. "
"How has no one noticed??? Go look up Ollie Murs ""dance with me tonight"" and tell me ""dear future 
husband"" isn't a straight up rip of that minus Ollie's vocal solo! "
"AWESOME Meghan Trainor is awesome no matter what everyone thinks Meghan Trainor 
haters gonna hate just ignore those mean and nasty comments a You ARE 
AWESOME! Love this album! "
"Megan trainer Is a really talented artist, her music is really catchy and a lot of 
people who are writing these reviews are not saying good things about her 
music and if you don't have anything good to say about it then don't say 
anything at all "
"Love it! Meghan, you and John Legend have a magnificent Harmony together... With 
this song, I became an even bigger fan than I was! "
"Meghan Trainor All about the bass is all about kicking some confidence into all of us 
girls regardless of size. We need more feel good songs like this. Go 
Meghan. You rock! "
Love Meghan She is awsome and so is this album it is catchy cool and amazing 
"Refreshing change Full of catchy do-wop channeling tunes this album is a sharp witty 
collection of memorable songs that get you singing along and make you feel 
like it's an old favorite the first time you hear it. Recommended! "
"So refreshing I love this album and even though my 11 year old tells me I need to listen 
to music my own age I still greatly enjoy her music "
"Love all about that bass and your lips are movin I don't care what other boys think (she's weird example) But I don't give 
a frick I love her I'm a boy but Im telling the other boys yo missing out "
"its okay I love Megan trainer but some songs are very repetitive like your lips are 
movin are just a fast version of all about that bass "
"Good music, but I am really surprised Google store didn't put some sort of a tag on this 
album indicating that's it's filled with inappropriate language. I am so 
used to hearing clean versions of her songs, and didn't even think twice 
what the originals might be filled. Definitely feel uncomfortable listening 
to this in the car with my kids. "
"Awesome Haters can complain all they want but this is one of the best albums of 
all time "
"Olly Murs ripped his song off, too Ya'll are the laziest reviewers, do some research. You hear the horn 
section in her songs? She has a 50s/60s doo-wop sound. That ""Dear Future 
Husband"" sample was from Dion's ""Runaround Sue"". And yeah, her songs are 
""woman-power""- another homage to 50s/60s. Some songs aren't great, but 
overall, it's a solid album. I haven't heard an album in decades that 
doesn't have 1 or 2 songs that fall flat. "
"The best album ever seen most definitely five stars! Nice bouncy exciting 
songs on there one of the best albums around "
"I am awesome!!!✌ I love Meghan Trainor!but I didn't donload this because you have to 
pay.But since I love Meghan Trainor I rate 5 stars! "
"On repeat!! I love her style and harmonies!! When she songs with John legend in like 
I'm gonna lose you is just amazing. Even the interlude is great!! She 
brings good different music to the table. "
"Great sound I love the sound that Meghan brings to the music world. She is so upbeat 
and catchy. "
"Talentless Absolutely rubbish, shows how little talent she has when she rips off the 
tune from Olly Murs' Dance With Me Tonight "
"Love it Amazing album sing amazing make up amazing every thing amazing you are a 
pop star "
"Good I love Meghan, but the free All About That Bass download doesnt work for 
me. But also, she has made 3 decent songs and the rest aint as catchy- hope 
this helps "
"Love it! Listened to the nightcore then this original one wonders why the song is 
so slow XD still in love w/th this 1 though and all u haters better shut up 
she is an amazing artist and how would u feel of someone hated on u? Why r 
u even here If u don't like the song!? Stop ruining it 4 other ppl "
"You suck Repetitive. Annoying. Overall new age garbage. You shouldn't be happy 
because a song resembles you,rather how you oversee allusions of propaganda 
and believe in yourself because you know its right for yourself. "
"She has a great voice and all her songs have such a fun, upbeat rhythm that 
I can't help but dance to. Unfortunately, her lyrics are often incredibly 
sexist and narrow-minded which drags the likeability of the songs for me. "
"Meghan love Meghan am your numder 1 fan. I love to sing your songs love you. you are 
the best singer in the world. I will love to see you but i can't because am 
little to drive love you i wish i can be you. DEAR FUTURE MEGHAN . FROM 
ARACELI ACA VARELA "
"Some Fun? I am disappointed with this album. After listening to songs such as the 
fun ones like All About That Bass, Lips Are Moving, and Dear Future Husband 
and slow songs like Close Your Eyes and Title, I expected something great 
out of this album. I was very wrong though. The whole album is a huge 
confusing mix. I didn't love it nor I hated it, it just felt weird, bad 
weird. Meghan Trainor won't be known forever. "
"Refreshing The over all sound, that combines oldies with new generation pop, is 
lovely. I truly enjoy the upbeat, positive message that she puts out there. 
Excellent way to boost women's confidence nowadays. Keep the good vibes 
coming. "
"Meghan Trainor is really an awesome artist, a star in the making. She found 
a way to integrate that classic doo-wop vibe with a decent touch of pop, 
and she can sing basically anything! The face gives me a hint of a younger 
Adele, but the voice is incomparable. Props to you! "
"she is such a talent! so glad to see her showing of her vocals on this album, close your eyes is 
just beautiful. so is love you like i'm gonna lose you! so happy that she 
is showing off those vocals & proving she is a real talent not just good 
for catchy pop songs, LOVE HER! "
"I guess if you're under 25 or so, you'll like it. If you're an adult... not 
so much. The lyrics are very immature. Some of the songs are catchy, but 
otherwise it was a huge waste of my money. #Disappointed "
"Trashy sexist songs. Her songs are so bad, and filled with sexist garbage. Terrible artist, 
terrible message sent to children and terrible songs. "
"She's a Fifth rate Adele She glorifies obesity, don't tell me she is 'curvy'. You can clearly see 
the fat in her face, it's sad and I pity her. I don't care if someone is 
fat or not, but to put out a song about weight and for you to be fat and 
glorify it is asinine. All I care about is the quality of the tracks. She 
is a mediocre singer at best. You can't really see her full potential 
because this album only showcases doo-wop/pop songs. If you want to hear 
her full vocal abilities listen to her Grammy performance with John legend. 
It was atrocious at best. To hear her struggle to hit notes is torturing. 
She should stick to her old day job, writing hits for performers. And you 
think she wrote those hits? In the industry 10 people will write songs 
together so they can split the royalties. She probably writes one stanza at 
most. Her career as a pop artist will go like the wind. Well that's pretty 
common for session songwriters with mediocre creative writing skills--no 
story whatsoever. Hey! She can be a backup vocalist. At least we don't have 
to hear her voice completely. "
"AAAAAAAH-MAZING! I LOVED your album, Meghan!!!! All your songs are really catchy & fun to 
listen to, and it's great to hear something so fresh and exciting!!!! Most 
of all, I love how you portray your feelings about girls who should not be 
judged by their appearance, rather by their personality (or not at all), in 
this biased society. It's great to finally have a singer in this world who 
know how to sing, make her own songs, AND smartly display her and others 
feelings about societal issues, such as the one's aforementioned "
"Meghan Trainor is awesome I don't care what people say Meghan Trainor is the best singer ever I love 
her album like my favorite song is dear future husband I love it it's a 
really awesome song I wish iwas Meghan Trainor is pretty she's so pretty a 
great singer and a good influence when she made all about that bass she 
saying that no matter what you perfect just like the song that pink 
made****ing perfect and Selena Gomez's who says all the songs say that you 
are perfect✌ "
"I love Meghan Trainor I real love Meghan Trainor, don't get me wrong. She has a great voice, I 
think she's very talented and has potential to go really far in her career. 
However, I'm going to have to be honest. This album had it's issues. There 
were some pretty good catchy songs, but ballads don't really mix with her 
voice. She gave it her best shot, I'll give her that, but the ballads just 
didn't fit. Overall, the album wasn't that great. Some of the songs just 
don't grab your attention, and it's very inconsistent genre wise. "
"Awesome, but... ...it is a little annoying to have her album out a little bit early, 
because only 2 of those tracks have been published so far, and, there's 15 
songs. 2 out of 15? Not great. I would of bought it, but it would be stuck 
in my phone, absorbing my memory. Great album by good-example setting Megan 
Trainor. But bring it out in a few months instead! Also, to all you silly 
people saying ""Oh its all the same!"" Etc. You're ignorant as when an artist 
records an album, they base it around the same rythm and genre. :/ "
"Meghan trainor She sounds like she is trying to sound like someone else the tracks are 
very similar she also throws the odd swear word in to try to be trendy but 
is it worth it when she sings in such a retro style "
"I loved it I wish I could sing like beautiful, lovely, pretty, amazing, 
fabulous Meghan trainor Love you Megan train or love you're songs. "
