"Foo fits it again To say I had high expectations for this record would be an understatement, 
and the boys didn't let me down. Knowing that the Foo Fighters traveled the 
US for inspiration for each track, I believed they captured the essence of 
American music throughout each song. The sounds of American music coupled 
with the classic Foo sound made this record a joy to listen to. "
"Great Album Lots of people moaning about it only being 8 tracks.. how well do you know 
the foo fighter's. ??? They'll put out another 8 tracks in a few months 
time.. the guys are workaholics ffs..:) Slane in 15 days..:) Wooo 
Hooo..!!!! "
"Mind blown away Not a bad song on here! Bought the CD for my dad for Christmas and he's 
been listening to it non-stop since! I've even actually bought a CD for 
myself! "
"Beautiful. This is music from geniuses. I wish people were more influenced by this 
beauty than One derpection and 5 seconds of a career, because this is art. 
A few guys singing some stuff about breaking up with a girl or falling in 
love with a girl, every single song, is crap. This, my friends, is art that 
should be followed. Not three chords played repeatedly with someone saying 
the same line over and over. Beautiful album, wish this was on popular 
radio stations more often. "
"Fantastic Album. Classic Foos. Enjoying ""In the Clear"". Will probably play this many times 
over just like Wasting Light! Thanks Amazon for delivering mine on a Sunday 
:) "
"Great album It's still a new album but I have listen to it so many times and just feel 
I'll never get tired of it. For me a perfect set of music by talented 
craftsmen. "
"If you haven't watched the series ...You won't understand the ideas and lyrics behind the music. 
This is the greatest rock band of our era. If you don't like Foo Fighters 
you're wrong!!!!....Matt Young calls it rubbish...It's his opinion but 
there's a difference between hearing and listening and he appears to be 
deaf. Donut!!...This album is class. "
"A bit underwhelmed Most tracks would just be B tracks on other albums. Would have expected a 
solid set of tracks, given there are just 8. Not a bad album, but just 
nothing to wake up at night for. "
"Nothing Surprising... Masterpiece! This may be the best album I purchased this year start to finish. 
Certainly the Foo's best work to date. Love the behind the scenes 
documentary on HBO. I am totally hooked. "
"$17 WTF $17 dollars for 1 maybe 2 decent songs. Sorry Foo you really dropped the 
ball this time. "
"Amazing Album! A great album. Some pretty sweet rifts and good tunes. Recommend buying it 
this instant if you are reading this. Also glad that Foo Fighters are back 
together, made my year :) "
"Awesome The HBO documentary that premiered on Friday 17th is part of a series 
leading up to the album release. Because each song is written all over the 
USA it picks up music from each city from the time music was being made 
there. So to truly appreciate the album watch the documentary because it's 
unreal! !!! "
"Not enough ! Only having 8 tracks makes me feels like I'm getting robbed! Foo Fighters 
are one of the best bands of this generation. There is no excuse for the 
low number of tracks on their albums. For this reason alone, I will not buy 
it! Shame really. "
"Proving again why they are so great The HBO series that goes with this album is simply stellar. This album is 
vintage Foo. Congregation is a new classic for me. I can't stop listening 
to it. It has that progression and creates those musical moments that I 
love so much from Foo Fighters. "
"Proof that music in it's purest sense is a true art form This amazing album is a product of Grohl and the boys discovering music in 
all places as shown on the #SonicHighways show they did for HBO. I've 
watched every episode and listened to every track and most certainly, 
without doubt, the #FooFighters definitely have talent and the ability to 
convey thought and emotion through their music. "
"Never disappoint Great follow up to WL. Waited so long for this, tracks like What did I 
do/God as my witness will have you screaming out the words with eighties 
fists in the air. F#?kin awesome. "
"Just Foo' Fools It's just good Foo'. Everyone should Foo'. Shuffle, Repeat, Play Annnd put 
the phone down. Nice! "
"Terrible The last (and only) record these guys ever put out was The Color and the 
Shape. The Foo Fighters are basically America's version of Nickelback, but 
most are too stupid to realize it. "
"Wale = Poetic Genius Wale is one of the rappers that makes you mad; mainly because he doesn't 
get enough credit for the work he produces. He, along with others like J. 
Cole, Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake, brings you back to when you were 
high school. It's almost as if they knew our lives. Wale has a way of 
making you bounce and think in depth about you next decision no matter how 
simple or complex it may be. Beautiful body of work. Great idea 
collaborating with J. Seinfeld "
"Great work Wale ! Let me start off by Thanking Wale for an 100% great Album! The beats the 
lyrics all come together so nicely. I have been a fan of him since 
attention deficit. I loved ambition, but wasn't impressed with Gifted with 
that being said this album has surpassed my expectations. I hope he 
continues to make awesome music. Only complaint I have is the constant 
Sienfied, voice overs and or comments !!! Other than that it has wonderful 
replay value! And can be played from front to back without skipping tracks "
"It's about a whole lot... For many, the first play will leave them confused by what they just heard. 
Wale's depth throughout the album is stunning and can only be understood 
once you listen to it multiple times. He shares a lot with us compared to 
previous albums which happens since his last album. Overall only one song I 
didn't care for was Body. The rest of the album was great. My favorite 
songs are the first four, The Intro About Nothing, The Helium Balloon, The 
White Shoes & The Pessimist. "
"Best About Nothing Wale always does very well with an About Nothing project. From his 
breakout Mixtape About Nothing to More About Nothing to The Album About 
Nothing. His flow is the best I've seen so far this year and the production 
is on point. You can tell he put a good amount of work. And the addition of 
Jerry Seinfeld throughout is a treat for the core fans who like Seinfeld's 
influence on Wale's tracks. Definitely my fave of the year so far. "
"The doubted I wasn't a fan of the last album but from start to finish he proves that 
he's not just a rapper, he's an artist. Can't say that about most the new 
artist. But i truly think some those that commented should go back and 
listen to his mixtapes because this is the him he was before MMG. Purchased 
and I love it. "
"Amazing It's pure it's real it's his personal conversation with himself to me it's 
well done he needs to get proper credit for being real and keeping it real. 
He doesn't front like he is this all positive rapper and he knows he has 
flaws. The Album is the best since his first Attention Deficit Disorder "
"Wale has returned to his pre MMG self and it is a breath of fresh air. 
Don't expect to be taken to a higher place like Kendrick attempted with to 
""to pimp a butterfly"", but it is a solid record front to back. I don't have 
to skip one song and I couldn't even do that with ""Dark sky Paradise"" and I 
thought that was solid also. "
"Late Buyer! First of all, I was not a fan of Wale. But after Wale's famous rant on the 
Breakfast Club, it made very curious about his music. I listened to a few 
songs off this album and I instantly fell in love. I had to purchase this 
album as it is very melodic and poetic. Wale has definitely recruited a new 
fan. Album is so fire, I can hear smokey the bear! "
"Solid album Very few albums can be played straight through with no skipping ahead. 
This album is one of those and its damned near flawless... Only flaw is 
Body (it's annoying), but I gave it five stars because Body is the last 
song on the Album. Lol "
"Finally I feel like Wale finally put it together with this one. Best music he has 
put out since More About Nothing. Decided to go with 4 stars instead of 5 
because there's some tracks I don't like as much but I feel they will grow 
on me. "
"Top 3 HIP HOP ARTIST This album clearly shows that wale deserves to be in the convo of Cole 
drake and big Sean he's better than 2 of those 3. However this album has no 
bangers but its still good to listen to. "
"Hands down, great album. 2015 has already been an amazing year for music, 
way better than '14. Wale made a classic album that will not be forgot 
about. When you mention D.C. artist, Wale comes to mind, and now when he's 
mentioned, this album will be one to remember. All tracks are produced by 
names not many have heard of, but they all go great with what Wale laid 
down. His verses from beginning to end, with hooks that are catchy. I'll 
definitely be buying the hard copy of this. "
"Growth Music At a time albums dropping so much trash bout time some artists change it 
up. This album is pretty good and I'm not a Wale fan but he got me with the 
song with Usher. "
"Mixed Feelings Although I hear Wale sounding ""forced"" to be clever with his lyrics, he's 
always been original. Open and transparent like J. Cole. Exclusive beats, 
positive messages and honesty holds this album down. "
"Been following wale since 06 and still in 2015 he hasn't let me down even 
with his contract with mmg... making deep music that a average listener 
will never comprehend. hip hop blues is here and this album is going to be 
dope. "
"Celebrity voice over isn't innovative Wale's a Mixtape About Nothing was much more clever with its use of 
Seinfeld theme music as sample material for its instrumentals. Even Wale's 
Seinfeld infused lyrics were much better on his mixtape. I keep giving 
Wale's studio releases a chance but continue to be disappointed everytime. "
"I love the songs! I rated this a one star, not because of the album, songs are nice, but 
because of the fact I purchased ""The Matrimony"", and every time I try and 
play it, it continues to say, ""temporarily unavailable""! Why is this Google 
Play Store?! It's like I've wasted my money! "
"Not bad but not great. Unfortunately, I think my ear for what's great in this era of hip hop 
isn't the same as others. This was decent work and I appreciate the fact 
that he's not afraid to attempt something different BUT his mixtapes are 
better than his albums hands down. The one thing that can't be denied is 
his lyricism. "
"Great year so far I wish more artist could find a way to bring rap back a little bit. I 
think wale, j.cole, kendrick, and big sean are ahead of the game. Or know 
how to make themselves sound like they are. Great album and lyrics. Easy to 
fall in love with. "
"Back to the PRE-MMG Wale... I see some of the negative vibes up here. Hard to believe anyone would 
down this album. To me, it's a classic. One of very few albums that can be 
played all the way through without skipping a track. I been ridin with Wale 
before Nike Boots. I rock with the MMG Wale but it's nothing like the 
Pre-MMG sound. Keep reppin for DMV fam.... "
"Great body of work, no skip button. Im oblivious as to why wale is slept on so much. He's dope and talented 
lyrically. People just love to hate. More less, keep doing your thing Wale! "
"One of my favorite albums of 2015 I really like Wale as an artist but for some reason I couldn't really get 
into The Gifted (but Ambition is my joint). The Album About Nothing was not 
really my thing for a minute but it's like one of those commercials 
jingles. First it's a little irritating. Then you hear it a few times. 
You're humming it in the shower. By the third listen it's ""Buy Mennen!"". "
"Sick 1st was Cole then Kendrick now Wale....all 3 albums was sick. The entire 
album was worth listening to without a skip "
"THIS is Wale I have loved every project he's put out. His albums are the kind that the 
more you listen, the more you love it. He never left, but I sure feel like 
he's back "
"1st album ever bought on Gplay. Amazing!! 10/10. Hard to give a full review as of yet but from what I hear so fat 
this is a classic album!! Great story telling. I hope wale gets the 
recognition he deserves. Love from the UK. "
"Its not bad But whatever loser said wale Kendrick and j Cole are hip hops new elite is 
a fuckin fucktard. "
"#TAAN Can't wait for the album to drop!!! Never been disappointed by one of his 
albums yet, and I own all of them and the mixtapes... Yea I'm a Wale junkie 
lol #moonz "
"Could've done better This album is kinda weak to me there's only 1 song I would download from 
this album "
"Solid Album If a person doesn't like this album, they don't listen to get they 
probably don't understand another music other than that ""turn up"" shyt. 
Smh. Great Album Wale. "
"Wale one of the greatest in my book I've been a fan for years because he raps about things I can relate to on 
a day to day basis he has a song for just about any situation Wale just dat 
nigga in my book. "
"B.A. Adela The first six tracks were like packaging. Tracks 7 -14 were pure hit 
potential. I really appreciate listening to the sample, and plan to 
purchase a download ""The Album About Nothing ASAP. "
"Great album I am from DC..I am in the Army and wherever I am at I always rep wale and 
the dmv.glad he came with a quality album. He had too..j.Cole was 
fire.Kendrick was fire..and wale has proven time and time again he makes 
quality. He is going back to the old wale finally.no disrespect to mmg 
because they gave him a opportunity. But they stuck on the coke and money 
the age of decadence I swear.People struggling or going to war for tuition 
money.Even the dirty dudes got foam. That one line shows you the city 
mentality "
"Innovative I throughly enjoyed the album it was very well put together from the intro 
leading all the way to the end not one track skipped. My favorite track(s) 
are ""Girls on drugs"" even tho it was on the mixtape. I also like the joint 
with Sza good way to remix Muisq Soulchild. And Jerry Seinfeld just fit the 
over all theme and tone he wasnt trying to do too much but what he gv was 
very effective. I honestly recommend a purchase 8.1/10 "
"Album About Nothing Clearly the opposite the album was about alot. Sheesh first j Cole then 
kendrick now this? These three are the new hip hop elite. No questions 
asked. "
"Support I could of easily gotten this album for free which I will before it's 
relate date but I still decided to support cuz for some reason people 
continue to sleep on Wale and I want his 1st week numbers to reflect how 
much his supporters rock with him. It's only $4.99 to support ya'll if you 
pre order support Falorin "
"I'm shocked. All the beats were fire. And every song had valuable lyrics. 
And many of the songs I can specifically relate to and the trueness of the 
lyrics hit me right in the heart. "
"Holy crap Can't stop listening.. like every song.. not even a former fan of wale 
that much but now I can not stop "
"Up There..... If this would've came out before some of the more recent albums like 2014 
Forest Hills Drive and To Pimp A Butterfly it would've gotten a better 
response. But since it came out later, my expectations are extremely high 
and it didn't meet them in terms of other high profile releases, but this 
still is one of Wale's best albums, and one of the best rap albums this 
year "
"Lover it! This album is absolutely beautiful. His word play, the story telling, the 
hope, the dreams crushed. He gives lots of things in the world new meanings "
"Great album front to back Great lyrics ,great concepts ,great production the engineering was great 
flow is on point honestly a feel good album. Not over saturated with 
features from the same artist , not saturated with trap songs or radio 
singles. You did great wale. I cant wait untill the next project! Have a 
good easter everyone "
Meanwhile back at mommas 
Much better than two lanes of freedom Amazing!!! 
He is a wonderful person with amazing music 
Sundown heaven town County 
Timmy boy is good 
"Unorthodox Album Absolutely love this album, its naughty in ways, but honest, fun and the 
combination of his voice, the background voices, and all the instruments us 
bazaar! I just wanna watch how they work it un the studio, its so 
interesting. Listen to this album quite a bit, driving back and forth! Just 
a great musician and glad I'm around to experience the music Bruno shares 
with all of us, young, in between, an eldest. This album is 100% awesome, 
thanx Bruno & band, keep em coming! ;-) "
"BEST ALBUM IN YEARS WOW!!!...NOT A BRUNO MARS FAN AT ALL BEFORE I WAS FORCED TO LISTEN TO THE 
WHOLE ALBUM, OVER & OVER ON A ROAD TRIP. NOW I FIND MYSELF PLAYING THESE 
TRACKS ALL THE TIME. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH. SUPERB ALBUM. ONE OF THOSE RARE 
ALBUMS WHERE EVERY TRACK IS A JAM. MARS IS THE DEFINITION OF AN ARTIST & 
MUSICIAN. YOU GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH ON THIS ONE. MUST BUY. "
"not better than the first but still good On first first listen this album did not live up to expectations for me. 
On second listen I realized this still a good album. Maybe because the 
first one was a little unpredictable to me. This album feels like Bruno has 
became a party animal to me. The album, as well as the first,does a great 
job on production and mixing. Solid 3 stars for me "
"Bruno Mars never lets u down with new songs Bruno Mars is a talented yung man the way he hits those high notes is 
amazing. He makes his songs about love & his relationship, its all true in 
his songs. In the song when I was your man just made me cry "
"BRUNO IS AWESOME!!! Those of you who hate Bruno mars go go listen to his songs again. I think 
you will love him then he is an amazing musition. I like his music so much 
when my girlfriend broke up with me I song when I was your man to her. And 
guess what I got her back so thanx Bruno! ;) "
"A must buy!!! Awesome album !!! I love every track, i got it for christmas my husband 
wrapped it up and put it under the tree. As soon as i opened it,I popped it 
in the stereo hit play and let it play every track. Awesome!! Love it, i 
love bruno's first cd as well. Bruno mars is one of a kind and i think 
everyone should have bruno in they're music collection <3 "
"<3 Bruno Mars I purchased the album. That should say a lot especially in this world of 
music piracy. Lol. But I had to buy the album after listening to the clips 
of the songs on this album. And I expected a lot since I loved Doo-Wops & 
Hooligans. And I am truly happy with my purchase. Even more so since it was 
$6. :) "
"Deep soul search with his lyrics. A takes a real man to admit when he's 
wrong.. Good music Is When u sing from ur heart... My favorite song of his, when I 
was your Man!! "
"He's a singer not a boxer.. Not Gorilla from Manila..but I'd really like to hit his chest, can ya hear 
me fella? I wouldn't if I could'a..'cause I probably would'a ended up 
saying BANG BANG GORILLA!! ♥ "
"Bruno Mars has been writing the best music I've ever heard! I totally love 
this album. My most favorite song from the this album is Locked out of 
heaven. His music is so good even my friends love him. Especially my friend 
Lauren. She loves him so much that she has a crush on him! Hope you come up 
with some more great music! (P.s. this is William Carter's daughter) "
"Bruno Knows Best! Not only was this better then the first album (in my opinion) but this was 
my favorite out of them all! especially Money Makes Her Smile! well good 
music makes me smile and that is exactly what this album did. Good Job 
Bruno! "
"Unorthodox Jukebox B. Mars by far is being over looked as a great artist. HIS Music has 
always have substance and you cant find that now really. He brings me back 
to my time, the early 80s. And now with this album, once again, he has out 
done it. Thank you B.Mars for being that great artist. "
"A Soulful Followup To Doo Wops and Hooligans Bruno Mars has really done it again this time after a successful followup 
to ""Doo Wops and Hooligans"". This soulful pop sensation is a real class act 
and is like a modern day James Brown. Among the best selections off this 
album include The Police inspired ""Locked Out of Heaven"", the sexy 
""Gorillas"", the 1970's soul inspired ""Treasure"", the tearjerker ""When I Was 
Your Man"" and ""Young Girls"". This album gets five stars and I am proud to 
have this on my playlist. Bravo Bruno!! "
"AMARSING I love it more than anything!! To all you haters out there: y'all need to 
tell me who is better right now! he is better than all of the teenage boys 
with songs that sound the same, it's bad enough that their voices are all 
the same!! Bruno is the best he will always be amazing!! "
"Best album ever Best album ever since Katy Perry PRISM and Miley Cyrus BANGERZ! Plus 
Natalie is his wife so he made a song for her(just in case you didn't 
know)! I :-) you Bruno! "
"The best that ever was,is and will be in the world. Bruno mars is my idol if i sing anything its songs by bruno mars and i 
know a lot of them really well. If anyone hasn't listened to bruno u are 
really missing out. "
"UNORTHODOX JUKEBOX /BRUNO MARS.Bruno Mars is on a Rocket Ship . It feels good to tap your toes and move your head to the mood again they 
have such a good relation(ship). More honest and rocking songs , Mr.10% do 
your thing. Good Luck Bruno & your Men "
"Deja Vu Honestly this album just sounds like 10 cliche, rewritten songs. Nothing 
original whatsoever. He is talented, no doubt, this has just been done 
before. Terrible album title also. "
"Orthodox jukebox is one of my favorite albums Bruno Mars captures every part of ur soul with his music. The lyrics of 
his music is understanding as if it came from you yourself. locked out of 
heaven and gorilla is so relevant to ones girl.. love ladies... art. "
"Truly Talented I thought the first album was great, but this one is freaking genius. At 
first I had my doubts about the retro feel to the album... but Bruno is a 
genius lyricist and a truly gifted vocalist. Any real fans of music should 
not hesitate to purchase this album! "
"He is amazing He is amazing because I he has a talent that he shares to people. He even 
puts his music on the radio and a lot of people probably just hear 1 of his 
songs, memorize that song, and bam they sing it with no music. That is how 
awesome his songs are. "
"When i was your man This song he made sounds like he knew my situation. I think this happens 
to be a lot of guys problem. Great song! "
"Speechless Bruno Mars is EVERYTHING to me i dont care what any other fan girl or guy 
, say his mine forever will be even if its just in my imagination. I love 
every song in his album , people say its crappy or whatever but i dont care 
you have your opinion but mine is if i ever need ANY type of motivation i 
listen to his songs and my moods lifts me up. I love him and everything 
about him. Yes im fan girling and i sound stupid but i just love his songs 
so much ! You go Bruno "
"Lilygurl Oops I had my song wrong. I got distracted and put it wrong. I meant ""When 
I was your man"". Its an awesome song, I gotta get it wit a few other songs 
of his. "
"I LOVE HIM I love bruno mars not only bcause how sexy he is, but also because of his 
great talent. He is apparently sexually creative so if I ever meet him face 
2 face it'll be very interesting. Hint hint. "
"Bruno Did It Again! Bruno Mars has an insane amount of talent and proves it with Unorthodox 
Jukebox. Many people may underestimate him, I think they'd be surprised to 
hear this album! I'm obsessed :) "
"Brilliant album This has a very retro and modern feel to it. Found it disappointing 
compared to his 2010/11 era songs at first but now I think these are 
better. Must buy! "
"What The Hell? You know how long i've been waiting for a album from Bruno Mars? && Now he 
comes out with this BS? Dont waste your money , I suggest you listen to the 
previews first. "
"Found a new artist! I use to listen yo Treasure on the radio but didnt know who sung it. 
Looked it up, anf HAD to get it! Bruno Mars is one of my new favorite 
artist! Gonna get the whole album soon!!!! "
"Sad and sweet Its a nice song but the thing is that he writes about what has happened to 
him…Bruno youll find that special someone whom you will write a song about 
and the song will be a happy not a sad one "
"A Nice (Disturbing?) Album! Love Bruno Mars and his quirkiness! I'm peeved that I'd already purchased 
""Locked Out Of Heaven"" and STILL paid full price for the download but 
that's an issue with Google, not Bruno. :0) "
"he not a modol wtf is going on omg lol cool song not like we own it. its way better than brono mars, songs petty 
good singer a PEOPLE IF THE WOLRD WTF OMG WHAT HAPPENED "
"Fantastic album & unorthodox mixup Album is sexxxxyyy! Must hear Moonshine, Gorilla, Locked Out of Heaven and 
Treasure!! Ohhhhh just listen to entire album and learn to appreciate Bruno 
Mars skills, hard work and dedication! "
"Incredible, Supercalifragilistically awesome! From soft ballads, to party anthems...From Reggae to Rockin' songs...Tell 
me what this guy cannot do!!! What a talent indeed...Heard so much about 
this guy, until i heard ""Runaway Baby"" from his first album....Then, I was 
on traffic listening to the radio and it happen to put the new song ""Locked 
out of heaven"", so i was like jumping to the internet and listening to 
excerpts from the album and as soon as i got into the four song of the 
album, i immediately bought it...Next is to see this guy on concert 
live...beautiful album, and if somehow gets many accolades, they will be 
deservingly so! "
"Who? Never even heard of this guy until now. Glad I never did. Sucks I know him 
now "
"Moving and beautiful. Art should move you, and his has done that one way or another with all 
these reviews he has either made people love or hate him. He has 
successfully reached his goal. Put passion in music. "
"eh, I LOVED the previous album Nothing really stands out for me with attempt. It almost feels like a 
different performer. Like I said, Hooligans is soul, and love, and 
emotional melody, and heart. Thanks for that, Bruno!!♥ "
"Bruno Mars - Unorthodox Jukebox Having had the pleasure of seeing Bruno Mars live, I know this album is 
the next best thing as it is so true to life. What can I say, he's an 
absolute showman and I love this! "
Bruno to the Moon #1 favorite singer of all times! His songs bring me to tears and joy! 
"He's a fraud. The song billionare , on the last album, he rips off Sublimes 'Santeria' 
by lifting the background music and singing his own lines over it. He also 
plagiarizes the rolling stones. Listen to the hooks and melodies on 'Wild 
horses'. He totally rips off the best part of that song. Wonder what he'll 
plagiarize next? "
"She has her own taste Lorde is different. Therefore I like different. People have their own 
opinions on her, which I like too. That's the music industry. There's an 
opposition in everything. The reason I like Lorde is because she expresses 
in a way where it's meaningful. She's not sexual or hateful towards people 
in her songs. She gets a 5 because shes only 18 and she's already making it 
big for herself. She's doing it well for the Kiwi folks here in New Zealand 
:) keep it up Lorde, you've got fans who support you either way. "
"Pop I can groove to I like pop and enjoy most of the buzz artists to a certain degree. But 
Lorde kicks things into the stratosphere with Pure Heroine. Her voice is 
golden, the backing music silky awesome, and the song compositions feel 
unique and unpredictable--in that excellent way that totally makes sense. 
Highly recommended for pop fans who don't mind deviations from the standard 
formula. "
"Fresh new sound in today's day in age. Pop music in all forms before Lorde while good, hasn't been exceptional 
and they all start to sound alike. This album is refreshing to hear for its 
unique sound backed up by fresh poetic lyrics. Heroine proves that music 
once again prevails by an artist taking it to another direction which it so 
desperately craves for. Five stars! "
"Interesting Lorde is a great singer, and I really like her songs. Only they are 
extremely repetitive. While the lyrics speak to the older teen generation 
specifically and have meaning behind them, there should have been more to 
the composition to her music. Also, the album sounds very autotuned, 
especially if you listen to her live (David Letterman), and while her 
personality is interesting, she's a bit odd for my taste. Still a great 
album, though. "
"Interesting. I have to admit the music is rather... interesting, it will be interesting 
to see what is to come. The people for her music while their intent is that 
of support, the methods on delivery are in poor taste. The people against 
her music should bring validity to their points, as they do get rather 
redundant with their delivery. While the music is unique it still has a 
long way to be a piece classified as a 'Bach' or 'mozart' as suggested it 
is yet to be placed as best. Wish the best in a fruitful career. "
"Love ""Royals"" wasn't blown away by any other songs Bought ""Royals"", absolutely love the song, very unusual, love the style. 
Was hoping that I would find more songs to buy off of ""Heroine"" after 
playing the samples. Unfortunately, I found the rest of the songs sounded 
very similar to each other, and most of the rest of the songs to be very 
""pop"". Here's hoping she develops some range and dimension in her music - I 
absolutely love her voice. Looking forward to hearing future material! "
"Different, but not spectacular While listening to the song previews, I had an appreciation for her style 
of music (it is different from a lot of songs I usually hear on the radio) 
and for her voice itself, which is very nice. I was especially surprised of 
the quality considering she's only 17 years old. However, all of her songs 
were very similar. I would have liked to see more of a variety. Also, 
despite her music being different, it just really isn't my style. I was 
bored by most of the songs. However, I liked ""Team"" "
"Lyrical Goodness Lorde has debuted greatly. She has a sound like that of Lana Del Rey and 
Adele while keeping her indie pop identity. This debut is that of an artist 
wanting to stay in the industry and wanting to grow up with us. She is only 
sixteen but has a voice of a near adult. I hope for more, deep meaning, 
albums from her. Five out of five stars. "
"Great Album Overall I believe ""Royals"" isn't even her best song. Her music gives an 
interesting take on music and expression. Just to let people know, in case 
u didn't "" Pure Heroine"", heroine Is a woman noted for courage and bravery, 
a very prestigious title. Shes not saying she's ""addictive"" lol. Plus the 
drug is spelled ""heroin"" "
"Surprisingly good I didn't know what to expect out of this album, I didn't really think that 
much of the song Royals when it came on the radio, or Team for that matter. 
However, now that I have listened to the whole album, I am surprised by how 
much I like it. Lorde is a very talented breakthrough artist and I am 
excited to hear more from her. Although I bought it at a discount, it is 
worth full price and you won't be disappointed. "
"Great album I really enjoy listening to tracks like Tennis Court and 400 Lux that 
boast catchy hooks and great beats. Other standouts on this album are White 
Teeth Teens and of course the chart-topping hit Royals. Lorde's voice is 
mature and her lyrics stand above the thoughtlessness of average pop. "
"Amazing album, Lots of detail and punch! The music is very detailed. There is a lot of attention put into the 
instruments and background vocals. I'm using Bowers & Wilkins 802 Diamond 
Series Loud Speakers with Classe power and pre amps. Very airy 
instrumentals. Puchy hard hitting drums in some songs & Beautiful vocals 
from Lorde. Nice to listen to on high end audio systems and overall a great 
piece of work by Lorde. I may have to purchase a high res audio version of 
this album - I will surely consider it! "
"Loved Lorde since I the first time I heard her on the radio. Her previous 
EP was definitely a masterpiece with lots of personality. However, this LP 
seems somewhat bland. Aside from the hits ""Royals"" and ""Team"", the other 
songs sound very alike. Still a good album thanks to the extraordinary 
lyrics of each song. "
"Fabulous, Fresh an just what we needed. It's been years since i bought a cd. After listening too a few songs, i 
realized, this girl has done a great job. Way too go. !!Just please I 
pray,she doesn't become no miley nasty girl sick stuff. "
"Pretty good Lorde really has her own style, and is really unique, but she can't really 
vary it that much. I think that her songs all sound sort of similar. If she 
had made major differences in all of her songs then I think it would be a 
little better. Still like this album though ♥ "
"Pure Heroine indeed. You must have pretty bad taste or no knowledge on art,music & poetry to 
not love such a great album. she basically captures what its like to be a 
teen & growing up to, fantasys and dreams she has all in great beats and 
layered vocal harmonies with simply & powerful poetic lyrics all written by 
her. not only the arrangements of the songs capture the message, but her 
silky smooth infectious voice has so much originality & beauty. "
"Lorde is a musical genius. I remember finding Lorde when she released the Love Club. She had me 
hooked since then. When Pure Heroine was released I was astonished that a 
16 year old girl wrote such a beautiful album. She is beyond her years. 
Definitely the kind of young musician the world needs today. She sings 
about things that are actually important, not sex drugs and money like the 
other young musicians in the game. A matter of months after I graduated 
high school I went for a long drive and I was reminiscing about all the 
good times I had while I was there. Ribs came on and it brought tears to my 
eyes. The song just has so much emotion, very few songs have been able to 
do that to me. I can't wait to see her future work. This girl is going far. 
She's going to change the industry for the better. "
"This generation's Rumors Lorde reminds me a lot of Fleetwood Mac. Music you really don't appreciate 
until you either get older or hear it enough times. The strength of the 
album is the approachability and inoffensiveness. No one really complains 
when Lorde comes on. That is something valuable that never gets the 
recognition it deserves. "
"Pure Heroine I personally love Lorde and enjoy her music. Her lyrics are quirky and 
sweet. If people understood her satire, they may appreciate her writing. 
Comments here are hysterical! Heroine- look it up in a dictionary of you 
think she's promoting drug use. "
"talented but lacking I love her talented voice but it clashes with the style of mainstream 
music. The only thing that caries the tune is her soothing voice. With that 
said, I easily get bored listening to this album. Such a shame. I would 
love to hear her paired with creative music that was better performed. I 
think it would deliver an exceptional outcome given the right materials. "
"It's hard to believe a 16 year old girl wrote this music But then again, it wouldn't make sense any other way. Lorde expertly 
writes with pure emotion and double meanings that speak measures about 
growing up in a society consumed in itself. "
"A rare gem It's rare to love an entire album, every single song on a CD, to listen 
many times and never get tired of it. This is an unique must have to the 
music collection. My favorite tracks are Ribs, Glory and Gore, and Tennis 
Court. The lyrics are not shallow at all and I can relate to her words. "
"Randy Marsh is a genius! He is Lorde, ya ya ya! I just don't know how he does it! Lorde's voice 
effects are done very good you'd never think it was from a middle aged 
geologist named Randy. This guy knows the formula to make autotuned canned 
pop for the emo, and teen angst masses. "
"Pretty Good Considering the fact that she's only 17, this is a very good album coming 
from a teenager. Her themes are relatable, especially in ""Buzzcut Season"" 
(which I believe is about cancer) and in ""Ribs"" I can't describe it. ""Ribs"" 
just makes me want to tear-up every time. "
"Good Job Lorde! As a singer myself, it is nice to hear a young person with talent that I 
being used wisely and without profanity. Good job Lorde. We enjoy your 
music. Remember, most people don't listen to the words in a song and 
understand where you are coming from, they will only have closed minds when 
it comes down to a really good new artist that they don't know. This album 
is great without a care! Love your voice and style. Don't change. "
"Well written. Real topics and detailed insights. Keep it up You people do know that this girl is 16. That alone makes her the most 
talented songwriter in today's game. So easy on the negative comments or 
demean yourself back to drake or big Sean......woah,oh god!! Boi "
"So so I readlly enjoyed her ep and was so excited about her album. But after 
listening to it I'm kind of dissatisfied, I was expecting more. Her voice 
is excellent but I feel most of her songs lack strong meanings and her 
lyrics are weak. I believe she can be an awesome artist, and I can see her 
improving in the future. I feel she needs more experience. "
"Not as good as I wanted it to be ""Royals"" is great, of course. ""Tennis Court"" and ""400 Lux"" are pretty 
good. But the rest of the album just sort of blends together--many of the 
tracks sound the same. The clever lyrics are the main thing holding this 
album together, but the lackluster music backing them up isn't enough to 
put the album over 3 stars (or maybe 3 1/2) for me. "
"Pure Talent In the days where artists are AutoTuned, fake, and use sex appeal as their 
selling point, Lorde is the next Big thing. She is not only a young and 
beautiful young woman, she has the vocals and writing talent to take the 
radio waves by storm. Greatest album since Adele's '21'. "
"Good Given her talent and beauty, amazing. The fact she's 15/16 singing about 
such things...kind of inappropriate. Beautiful voice, good beat. Not the 
best ever but it's a refreshing sound that's on the market. Un like the 
unoriginal Justin b, miley. "
"Fantastic aural presence with some poetry I'm not much of a pop listener, usually a prog metal guy. But this album 
combines some of my favourite things I look for in music: great sense of 
atmosphere... it is very easy to get lost in the sounds and the space in 
between. It's almost minimalist (it isn't). There is a phenomenal range in 
the sounds and tones... The production is fantastic, and it goes well 
beyond her clear, haunting voice. And the last bit of spice is the lyrics. 
It is just ambiguous enough to keep you interested. Fantastic, dfn recmnd "
"Boring!!! This song is too plain. It has a horrible beat and her voice doesn't make 
it any better. I can't stand how lorde talks crap about every other music 
artist either. It sounds like she has a jealousy problem if you ask me. She 
should look into a different career. "
"Xx cc ooooooocoooooooooooooopoooo goggzzo kkk Jo vo Ooooooo Jo ohoogg Jo

"Not at original as everyone claims. IMHO LORDE seems to be following a style that was originated Lana Del Rey. 
listen to them both and you'll see what im talkin about. I'm not putting 
down LORDE's talent or ability to be great. Just sating that she isn't as 
original as she is given prise for. "
"Avg. I suppose Royals is ok, but it sounds like rambling gibberish written by a 
goldfish with a second grade education.(Lyrics make no sense). All the 
other songs just sound the same. In my personal opinion, Lorde is just 
piggybacking on the success of other similar artists. "
"Disappointed a little She has a good voice but the only good songs on the album are her radio 
releases. She has a gift of coming across more mature than her actual age 
but with song titles like ""tennis court"" ""white teeth teens"" and also ""buzz 
cut season"" she seems to run dry on song material. "
"I don't see how anyone can listen to her. Her songs make no sense. Seems 
like all u need is a good voice and beat to get signed now a days. U can 
say that about most music now a days tho. There's no soul in the songs 
anymore "
"It's not a ""style"", it's just the same The whole album sounds the same, and not as ""she has a certain style"", it 
just sounds like one long song. I'm glad this was free, but I still might 
have overpaid. 2 stars Just cause I at least got to listen to the one 
popular song. "
"Her music explains actual problems Lorde's songs arent just about love and stuff, it actually tells about 
problems that she and other people face. Just everyday things at times. 
Royals and Team are my favorites. She is a great artist and totally worth 
listening to "
"Only 1 SONG!.. Don't LIKE HER COVER ON THIS CD. BECAUSE, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS PROMOTING 
THE KILLER STREET DRUG!! KILLING OUR TEENS OF AMERICA!!! SHE MIGHT WANT TO 
RECONSIDER CHANGING IT! I do like Only 1 Song! That is ""ROYALS!""'..... "
"Genuine music/lyrics and great beats Tyrese has R&B's essence packed into one album. No lame pop with 
meaningless lyrics. Deeep stuff and a great listen for any mood "
"Just awesomeness voice to listen, and so pleasurable for anyone who loves 
intimacy music. Keep up the good work Tyrese. "
"Everything and more This album is pure soul & rnb a old school flavour with a contemporary 
feel to it "
Great album If you want pure R&B this is your album 
"Tyrese is real. Nice rnb smooth, easy on the ears ;) "
Voice Man its on point nd lyrics are cool 
Black rose 
Love it He isn't playing 
Amazing Heaven yeah 
Awesome Best album 
Awesome Album!!! 
It should''ve been us The songs is very great 
There's not a single track that you can hate! 
Best song ever I love it sooooo much!!!! 
Luuuuuv it Gorgeous album loved it 
Love her! 
"Progression of Musical Talent I have been with Five Finger Death Punch since the beginning. I have 
always been a fan and will remain so always. Through the years they have 
always added something new to their albums. I will always be a diehard fan 
of their original work but understand that as the times change so must 
they. Much in the sense that Disturbed has and many other rock bands who 
started out heavier than they are now. Ivan has a great voice, one that 
once it grips hold of you won't let you go. I highly recommend this album. "
"Love it Love the album been their fan since they came out. I don't know why people 
say they suck. If u don't like them don't listen. Go touch yourself to the 
backstreet boys or something cause they r still a great band my favorite 
songs on the album are all of them but boots and blood. I'll still listen 
to it by vocally just sounds weird to me. "
"Love it! For all those who have ever loved hard Rock/heavy metal this is definitely 
an album for you. And whoever says these guys became radio friendly.... 
Listen to ""Jekyll and Hyde"" and ""boots and blood"" again. Tell me how many 
times they'd have to hit the edit button. Just sayin "
"Bill Barbato five finger death punch... One of the best bands around. In a day where crap is considered rock these 
guys have still been true to themselves and kept rocking. Before you razz 
another band put your money where your mouth is and make an album of your 
own that is not crap. Then place sed album in this very store. Let the 
masses deside for themselves. "
"Real American music What more can you say. They impress me more and more every song. Im so 
tired of all the rap hype when it has no meaning. If you listen closely to 
rock metal heavy metal and evem classic rock you can here meaningful verses 
. But ill leave on best Music album of 2015 hands down "
"Heard previews of all the songs Every single one is just as amazing, and the sounds definitely vary. An 
earlier review says that the sounds for different songs are from the 
different album era's, and I agree. Some sound like way of the fist songs, 
others have the fast heavy style of American capitalist, some have the 
lighter style of some of the wrong side of heaven songs, some sound like 
war is the answer, but one or two have their own unique style and twists. 
All in all, I love this album already before it's even released. "
"5FDP SUCCESSFUL IN 2015 I went and bought the limited deluxe version that best buy had with the 
shirt today. Popped it in my stereo and immediately fell in love with the 
album track 6 ""No Sudden Movement"" is probably my favorite track on the 
whole album. Can't wait for more from these guys. "
"Great album much worth Let's not mention the guy that days he hates 5fdp and loves heavy metal, 
then proceeds to list nothing that is metal as his favorite metal bands. 
Scathing sarcastic commentary aside, I really like this album. I personally 
have been liking the changes since wrong side of heaven, seems to be harder 
metal, which I like and No Sudden Movements and Got Your Six are freaking 
great, amongst my favorite tracks I've heard. "
"If you like these guys like i do get this album now do not hesitate!!!! Awesome songs i can almost simg with them great beat and rythm (of course) 
all the track are really good. Dont listen to the critics who may soon post 
theor opinions they just jealous cause they aint as good. "
"F*** yes. 5FDP is back, putting boot to a** and reminding us all why they are still 
not to be trifled with. From 'Boots and Blood' to 'Jekyll and Hyde', this 
album is in your face brutal. To those that say 'Radio Friendly', What 
radio station have you heard that allows that much swearing? The last thing 
I would call 'Boots and Blood' is radio friendly. "
"Best Ever Download NOW!!!! FFDP is the best ever and all these haters need to shut up and accept that 
this band... There ain't no better just shut up and deal with it... Haters 
shut up and actually listen to them and maybe u might like there songs some 
u might not and some u might like so just give them a shot at the big time 
and actually listen for a change!! "
"Jekyll and Hyde Love the lead single. I heard a snippet of the title track Got Your Six, 
This Is My War, Ain't My Last Dance, Hell To Pay and the album so far 
bounces the sound from each album. Got Your Six is definitely War Is The 
Answer era, This Is My War is American Capitalist era, Hell To Pay is Wrong 
Side of Heaven era, while Ain't My Last Dance is Way Of The Fist era. "
"Good But Have More Potential I love Death Punch but with this album it seems like they didn't really 
put much thought into it, a lot of the songs repeat the chorus every 2 
seconds and they just rushed it. They just released 2 albums and have been 
touring a lot I'm not sure how hard they truly worked on this album but 
with all of that going on I feel like they just pushed this album out. I 
think if they took their time and poured their heart and soul into the next 
album it will be their best. "
"Okay, I'll admit I thought this album was going to be trash because I am 
not a fan of Jekyll and Hyde. But then I listened to Ain't My Last Dance, I 
Apologize, This is My War, and Wash It All Away and oh my god I am blown 
away. This is like a combo of Way of the Fist and War is The Answer. Its 
PERFECT. "
"Album of the year♡ This album is so diverse. It's one of the best albums I've heard this 
year. Yes, they have become a bit more radio friendly, but that means radio 
stations will play more of them! It's a mix of all their albums, and I 
relate to ever song one way or another. Thank you 5FDP ♡ "
"Always has been awesome. Always will be. As usual, theres that niche of people that act as if theyre getting worse 
because they dont keep the same sound, but in my opinion they're just 
expanding the greatness. Everyone that dislikes their songs for not 
sounding the same are fools. The variance is one of their best qualities. "
"These Guys. I haven't even heard the whole album. Only Jekyll and Hyde. But, I have 
loved this band ever since I heard Hard To See for the first time, and they 
managed to stay A+. Five stars for Five Finger Death Punch. "
"Awesome All of you haters trashing these guys, I have one thing to say. Try 
putting countless hours into an album, then talk. Until then, keep your 
mouth shut! "
"It sounds sappy. We all know 5FDP is going through some tough times and it really shows in 
this album. Far from there best and doesn't have the energy they once had. 
Most of the songs try to recover from the lack there of in the 
instrumentals. Good instrumentals but over all lackluster. "
"5FDP is amazing Every song they come out with is unique and amazing. Every album blows me 
away and its a mainstay in every playlist I have. Keep the music strong and 
keep em flowing! \m/ "
"Just plain sick I'm listening to the who album on XM Octane right now, w/ member of the 
band talking about each song. Haven't heart a bad song yet. "
"My go to band Like it or not, these guys have great talent. The perfect mix of heavy 
with excellent vocals. Heard them for the first time last year and I 
immediately collected all albums. "
"FFDP is one of my all time favorite bands! So far I love the sound of the new album...and for all the haters that say 
the last 3 have sucked...you're idiots. They're all great...very different 
sounding...worth listening to on repeat for sure. "
"Awesome! I personally LOVE five finger death punch. From the cussing to the insane 
instrumental work. It's not my personal favorite album but if you love FFDP 
as much as I do you will not be disappointed. "
"A step in the wrong direction... I really enjoy listening to there heavier rock albums...and quite frankly 
I wish they would go back to that. Although Got Your Six is still a good 
album nonetheless. "
"They get worse! Uggghhhh! Terrible and more terrible. Their first album was great but they 
sink deeper into an abyss of suck! "
"I absolutely loved it. This is my favorite 5FDP album. It's perfect in every way. I own all of 
the albums and really enjoy them but this one felt like a combination of 
all of them and I loved it. Some songs have a wrong side of heaven and the 
righteous side of hell vibe, One or two have that American Capitalist sound 
and the rest all have that amazing War is the Answer and Way of the fist 
sound. I highly recommend this. Favorite song is Wash It All Away. "
"One of the best they have put out. Haven't been. A fan long but know I'm 
hooked and bought every cd and itsits the first thing I listen to at the 
gym "
"Very disappointed I saw this and expected instructions on the technique used in Kill Bill 
Vol. 2. There were none, just some loud feedback. Very confused and 
disappointed. "
"Amazing album!! The only thing I hate about this is Google's fault. Make an update where I 
can listen to music without using WiFi!! Just like Apple products once you 
buy the music you don't need any internet to listen to music. Must fix this 
Google! I'm using up so much mobile data to listen to this amazing band "
"Was Worth the Wait! Ignore what the others have said about the band becoming ""more 
radio-friendly"". The band has made their decision, and it is the people's 
choice to continue to listen or leave. For real though, don't just sit 
around griping. Actually listen to the lyrics, the solos, and just forget 
about the little things. They simply don't grasp the concepts that the 
lyrics employ. "
"Definitely lived up to the hype To the people that think they are going soft, they ain't, they are drawing 
in a new type of audience, tons of bands do that, it's to make more money, 
I've been in love with this band since their War is the Answer album, first 
album I've ever bought because their take on Bad company lured me in and 
eventually got me into the heavy side of their music. Overall the album was 
just fantastic, especially the got your six tour, that was breath taking. "
"Sad I pre ordered this album like a month ago and when I went to download it 
this morning it won't download. So I went back and accidentally purchased 
the clean version so most of the cuss words are blanked out. I have been 
trying to download the explicit version and it keeps saying it won't 
download. Does anyone know what's wrong with this or how to fix it? Its an 
amazing album nonetheless but I hate the cuss words being blanked out "
"Five Finger Death Punch Cant hate any of it. People that hate this are just very close-minded and 
look for flaws in everything just listen and enjoy and you will love it "
"FFDP 1 VS HATERS 0 This band has busted their azz to be where they are at so people saying 
they suck and are no good are complete idiots and apparently cant 
understand the amount of success and fans they gained so stiff it haters 
and if you think you can do better step up or shut up. "
"Not bad..... Not their best. They have become radio friendly. I bought the deluxe 
version. The last four songs of this album, I really liked along with got 
your six. Not a bad album over all. "
"Oh my. I've listened to them since the only song they had out was the bleeding. 
And I have loved every album since the way of the fist. I have yet to hear 
a song by them that I don't like. Probably the best band ever. Lol "
"Hell Yes! I have been Listening to You Guys Since 2005 Your Band Is My 
absolute Favourite Of All time, Nothing else compares. it has Helped me 
follow my wildest dreams and Even through the hardest times, Stay Great 
5FDP you guys are the best. Cant wait for the new album! "
"They sound like they're trying too hard They kinda suck and sound commercial. Album Cover art would have you 
believe you were purchasing a death metal album if you didn't know any 
better. Is this rap-rock? "
"The best modern rock band ever I have been lisining to u since I was 9 and im 15 right now I listen to 
you over and over after I get bord with my other music I play you guys in 
school at home in the bath room and when I party but whenit comes to the 
meanings of your songs it feels like your me cause I have a dad thats a 
jerk and my mom and dad always argue then my dad blames me for evry thing 
but you make me happy at the end of the day "
"Into the woods soundtrack This is amazing, I've seen it three times and still love it! My favorite 
movie right now, by far! Thank you Stephen Sondheim! Anna Kendrick - 
brilliant, emilly blunt - amazing, and don't even get me started on Meryl 
streep!! This album is pure gold! Absolutely Love It! "
"Brilliant Recommend it, it's funny, sad, and it's a musical about stories we've 
known since we were a little kid but with a twist (p.s. Don't listen to all 
the haters.) Go see it for yourself. Just remember we lol have different 
opinions "
"A ridiculously funny movie This movie is funny but ridiculous and has really great singers and a 
great soundtrack, 5 stars. LOVE IT! But I can't buy and don't want to, it's 
too much. "
"AGONY!... not Awesome soundtrack. The movie is amazing and the best part is the 
soundtrack. Equal parts beautiful, funny and sad, this one's a must buy. 
And I can't stop lip syncing to agony in front of a mirror with a 
hairbrush. "
"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN In the woods is brilliant because the whole story is when your in the 
woods you don't know what will happen .But you have to adapt to what 
happens and there talking about life. You don't know what will happen but 
you go with it and learn life lessons .And what better way is there to 
express that than classic fairy tales .Plus the music works so well with 
what they are feeling .I think this is one of the best movies I have 
experienced because people I can cater to peoples situations.That is what I 
love most "
"Perfect... Um...no....AGONY The best album that I've seen. The only problem is there's a lot of 
""songs"" with just music in them. I still recommend this album for anyone 
that loves into the woods. "
"One of My Favorite Musicals! This music is gorgeous and wonderful! My favorite dong would have to be 
Agony. It's just too funny. <3 "
"The only reason I rated it more than 2 stars was because I like the music 
with words. Its true, as you can see in other comments that the little 
snippets of music that has no words and lasts 17-50 seconds are pointless 
and you should not waste your money on those for $1.29 each! I love the 
songs though. (The real ones, with words.) "
"Spectacular Watched the movie this evening, it was absolutely amazing so well written. 
Costumes were beautiful and the music is outstanding. Its an album of the 
movie so it should be all the little parts and big parts which is what they 
have done beautifully. So pleased with this movie and the soundtrack! Its a 
definite must see! "
"Worst produced ever Producer obviously has NO CLUE what a musical is. This album consists of 
every snippet of music and fill, broken into tiny 15, 30, 45 second bits. 
Worse, the producer doesn't understand the SPOKEN parts of a song are PART 
of the song - so every spoken, rhymed segment is NOT included. Songs with 
spoken segments are cropped around those segments. This seems produced by 
someone (or a machine) that had NO understanding of the material. TERRIBLE. 
Don't waste your time or money. "
"Pride Not only is James Lapine a genius, he's my first cousin. I am extremely 
proud of him "
"Masterpiece Never have I ever experienced a film with such immersive sound. Each song 
is perfect, and I appreciate Stephen Sondheim for being excellent in his 
work "
"Into The Woods Original Motion Picture Cast Soundtrack I love each song, but I would have to say that Stay With Me and The Last 
Midnight are by far my favorites. "
"Best songs ever!!!! The songs were perfect some words are repetitive but hey it's catchy as 
hell so I recommend it to anyone who has seen or hasn't it doesn't matter 
it was phenomenal. "
"Great This was the best movie that has came out in a long time if your not so 
big on musicals watch it anyway if you love musicals it is great. Don't 
listen to anyone who says it isn't good see for yourself!!!! "
"Perfect!!!! Omg all I can say is I am obsessed! It has been two days and I already 
have all the songs memorized! Lol "
"LOVE IT It's an amazing movie, and a great soundtrack. This is probably one of my 
favorite musicals ever!! "
"The best thing EVER!!!!! Loved this movie with all my heart which means I'll love this album just 
as much!! "
Loved it I loved the movie and it felt like I was watching the movie itself. 
It's sooo good! Loved the movie so this album is just so perfect! 
"I savoured many moments in this movie! Great acting, great voices... & 
beautifully modified fairy tales. "
"Into the woods The voices mashing together was beautiful and the different ages makes the 
sound much better than any other songs... Job well done "
AMAZING I love all of these amazing songs created by AMAZING artist 
"Into the Woods! OMG I just saw that movie yesterday, I loved it! "
Genius! Soundtrack and movie were AMAZING. Made me feel like a kid again. :D 
Good job I love the song agony it was hilarious 
Utterly speechless Exceptionally profound! 
"Such a great Soundtrack I can't wait to see the movie! The instruments and singers in this album 
are both amazing! "
"Into the Woods Wonderful musical, the collection of acting and vocal talent is amazing. 
You should also see the movie. "
"Awesome I love all the tracks on this album. This album is just down right 
awesome!!! "
Amazing The next big thing after les miserables 
"Into the Woods Step over Wicked, I've found a new favorite musical. Into the woods "
Ya Best movie of the year get this album! 
"Amazing This is my favorite musical, and the movie cast does an amazing job. Great 
voices. "
Into the woods Its one of the best movies I have ever seen very cleaver 
Any moment I like Cris Pine 
"Loved it But why on the cover it says ""johnny depp as the wolf"" I don't get that. "
Yassssss! Even though I haven't seen the movie I love the songs 
Picked good singers! They must have put the right actors together! It was really good! 
Love it so much More than 30 song that so cool. I went to watch I 
"Addicting album Jason's vocals are amazing throughout and immediately catch your ear. What 
becomes addicting are the completely sick, unique, and wonderfully catchy 
beats. This album was produced in an amazing way, and I highly recommend 
it. (Please ignore the reviews from people who don't like any rap/pop, 
their reviews are painfully biased and asinine) "
"Love it! I have to admit that when Jason left Jordan Sparks I swore I'd never 
listen to his music again for breaking her heart, but he won me over with 
this gem of an album. Every song speaks to me whether it's making me dance 
or making me sing. His best yet by far! "
"Absolutely Love It Jason never seems to fail me. I discovered 'Cheyenne' on the radio and 
immediately had to have it. 'Want To Want Me' was always a favorite to 
begin with, as well. Definitely give them all a chance, though! "
"Way to offer the Clean version for Free But you don't offer the Explicit Version for Free. We aren't all kids. 
Some of us are over 30 years old. Google Play you suck. "
"This is a great album. Possibly Jason's greatest. Try Me and Get Ugly are 
dope! And I totally heard Want to Want Me before it was cool! 5* "
"It alright it sometimes makes me cry to me its more like a sad music but if 
your with your friends IT A PARTY peace "
"Its just repeating The same phrase/word repeated and his voice sounds like he got punched in 
the nuts "
"I had no idea this album was new. It came on my Spotify a lot and I really 
like a lot of the songs I assumed it came out a while ago and was just 
never appreciated but was I wrong... I love it so much (especially 
Cheyenne) "
"AMAZING I love the new Derulo I wish he was dating Jade from little mix though, 
they would make such a cute couple, Love the album! "
I can't believe this horrific cd! TERRIBLE !TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE ! 
Jason Derulo Get ugly Best song ever 
"He used to be good His pop career killed his music his music is high pitched singing with a 
good beat WASTING GOOD BEAT "
"So many good songs! A different sound than the previous album - I really 
enjoy Cheyenne, Get Ugly, & Want to Want Me. Great for summer road trips! 
:) "
"Preordered & signed I preorder this very especial debut 4th album of jay""s. I make good love

"Everything is 4 , but yo album cost $7.49 Lol just sayin "
"Free play doesn't work I took one of those surveys for free plays, and it never have me my free

"Get ugly OK but I think get ugly and want to want me is the only really ones I 
listen to! "
"False advertisement This album is to be free this week went to download it and it wants to

Get ugly The best music i herd from his album 
Get ugly So far the best song. Jason never disappoints 
"Everything Is 4 I am absolutely loving get ugly because about 8 hours ago on YouTube I 
listened to it and I completely agree that this song get ugly should soon 
get a video and I think cheyenne should get one too "
"""Trade Hearts"" is AMAZing...two creative artists collide!! I came in search 
for ""Want to want me""...and found this gem! I enjoy the other songs but 
these two were great first listen. "
"Love it!! Jason Derulo's songs are amazing!! I always listen to him at home, 
especially ""Want to want me""! "
Never ceases to amaze me Im a big fan of JD. Hope he keeps up with the good work 
"I Absolutely Love this I love this album and Jason Derulo I've seen all his concerts they are all 
amazing but everything is 4 is amazing and definantly my favourite !!!!! "
"Want To Want Me Is the best song! I love it, I cannot stop listening to it! "
His songs just get stuck in my head ☺ 
Any music I click Any music that I click is loading slow can't can't hear no music at all. 
"I wouldn't recommend it I really didn't like this much because the only song i know is want to 
want me and i think that song is SUPER ANNOYING and the only songs i like 
is trumpets and talk dirty and wiggle. "
Nothing special Not creative and very below average music. Good songwriting though. 
I love this song so much it makes me want to get up and dance 
Don't like He's needs to go back. This evil is not good 
Terrible Get rid of this feminizing pop crap and we will have a perfect world 
Just as bad as Bruno mars This guy is a disgrace to American music 
Get ugly This is awesome I wish I had this song 
"Bet album you'll ever hear So I wrote a review but then accidentally deleted it. Nice. Anyways, I 
love the album, the sound of it, the lyrics, I just love everything about 
it. The best is how the album ends with the lyrics ""you know it's gonna get 
better"" I can't even tell you how many times I've listened to outer space/ 
carry on. There's no better way to close an album than that. I'm so proud 
of you boys, I wish I could buy all the copies and go to all your concerts, 
there's no way to get sick of these songs. "
"TAKE MY MONEY LOVE THIS ALBUM EVEN THO ITS NOT OUT YET :D all the songs so far are so 
good!! Have to wait forever for this album but its worth it. I love them so 
much they're my angels :) "
"? I love these guys theyve done so much and climbed so tall so fast. So 
there is nothing wrong with them or there songs. But is this album out yet 
and if so when was it. As i have pre-ordered and is saying listen but it 
will not download onto my music player and it is saying listen and i can 
not listen to it "
"So proud of them You can tell how much effort they put in this album. The lyrics are deeper 
the music cooler. I am so impressed and happy with this album. Castaway, 
Catch Fire, Broken Home, Airplanes, The Girl Who Cried Wolf, Jet Black 
Heart.... I would end up listing the whole album if I tried to pick a 
favourite song. Loved it alot. "
"I love all of them. I can't believe I saw that one video in 2011 then in 
2013 I saw them on tour with One Direction(I'm still a fan of them❤) One 
direction and 5 seconds of summer saved my life. Ashton helped me the most. 
I'm in love with all they're songs so I'm glad to see them come so far. "
"Oh. My. God. I just listened to the album and these boys could never make me more 
proud. Every single song is beautiful, but so far, my favorite has come out 
to be ""Vapor"". Buy this album and feel every strum of the guitar strings 
and beat of the drum in your veins. "
"Still a great family-appropriate band! I primarily listen to Heavy Metal, The Blues Rock, Grunge, and Punk. These 
kids are bringing back the popularity of punk to the masses, in a way 
that's radio friendly! People ditch on me all the time for listening to 
5sos, but it's awesome. When I heard the few new songs they released I 
thought they lost their edge, but even this music elitist can be wrong! 
They're better than ever, taking their previous songs and throwing them out 
the window for something 10x more apealing to the masses, including men! "
"I Pre-ordered and it is not downloaded. I pre-ordered this album when it first came out, and now I want to listen 
to it. But, it will not sync to my library so I cannot download it to my 
device. I paid money for this so I would like to listen to it. If anyone 
could help that'd be great. I love 5sos and wish I could listen to their 
album. I will not be buying anything from Google play music again. "
"Too amazing I love this band too much. But I hate them for taking over my life. To be 
honest I'm kinda tired of hearing fetus sauce.. SO OCTOBER COME QUICK SO I 
CAN HEAR MT FOUR TREE SIZED MAN CHILD'S! "
"Incredibly talented For 5 Seconds of Summer, there is no such thing as a sophomore slump. This 
album is a clear indication of their growth as musicians, lyricists, and 
singers. I know I'm going to be completely blown away and immensely proud 
of these fine young men. Their released tracks so far, (She's Kinda Hot, 
Fly Away, Jet Black Heart), have exceeded any and all expectations of a 
""pop"" band. They're going above and beyond to the world of rock and punk 
music, and I'm ecstatic. "
"I CAN'T WAIT 5sos are my favorite band and i've been waiting for this album for so 
long! after hearing permanent vacation, she's kinda hot, and fly away, i 
can conclude that my boys are finally pop punk, no doubt about it. they 
take after legendary pop punk artists, and i'm proud to be a part of the 
new broken scene. i wish october 23rd would come around already!! "
"OMGG AWESOME AMAZEBALLS EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN These four idiots are my life and I'm sssooo happy that I get to see them 
pop out another album that they've worked ssoo hard on!! They thought 
people weren't going to like it but are releasing it and we LOVE IT!! "
"Literally in tears I'm so proud of these boys, even more proud of the music they make. 
Forever will they be important and remembered for me. They aren't going 
anywhere, anytime soon. I love these boys like family, because that's what 
they are for all of us. "
"Pre-order So i pre-orederd today and i haven't gotten any of the songs that were 
supposed to instantly download? I resarted my phone and everything and its 
really aggrevating "
"Cant wait! I'm so proud to say that I have been here since the first album. It seems 
that every time they release a new song/single they get better and better. 
Much love❤ "
"5 stars but minor problem 5 stars for the album, because its 5sos. The problem is, I have yet to 
hear the album. I pre-ordered this somewhere around August, and my payment 
went through and it says i have the album. But i cant play it. I've tried 
several times and it says that its syncing. Now maybe im stupid, which is a 
very high possibility, but i thought the album would be on my phone by 
now?! Whats the deal? "
"I love them. They have gone so far since posting covers on YouTube to now 
were they are selling out stadiums and selling albums. I'm so proud of you 
guys and I'll be here for you no matter what.! "
"It's illegal to give any less than 5 If you give any number less than 5 stars you are irrelevant, 5sos for a 
reason. Because they are always 5 stars. Honestly this band is amazing. 
Love them so much. And it's true they sound good, so it feels good "
"I've been a huge fan for a while and the guys have grown up lyrically and 
it amazes me so much.Their 2nd album shows how much they've grown if you 
compare it to their first. They are bringing up and talking about serious 
topics in ""Jet Black Heart"", ""Broken Home"", and ""Invisible"". These guys are 
so young, yet they know how to write amazing lyrics, play instruments 
beautifully, and still stay kind souls. "
"Absolutely love it!! I loved their first album and their second album is just as great! This 
album is about stuff that almost every person has or had to deal with and I 
think that was really what they were going for, that is album is to help 
people find a way to escape from their problems. "
"TOTALLY STOKED ABOUT THIS ALBUM!!! It feels like I have waited decades to pre-order this album. I don't know 
about you, but I literally cried when I found out the release date. I just 
can't contain myself anymore. Hopefully October gets here fast, but watch 
it just slowly come rolling.... "
