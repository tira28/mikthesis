"Sounds Good...Feels Good I got this the day it came out and im in love with it! 5sos have come a 
long way since when they were only playing for like 30 at most and now here 
they are playing for 2000+ people! I went to a ROWYSO show with my best 
friend and I will never forget that teenage memory[see what i did 
there.lol] for as long as i live! My favoriates are Vaopr,Castaway,Broken 
Home,San Fransisco and Waste the Night! Im so gkad i have these 4 guys in 
my life...they may not know me at all but they help me with a ton of 
things! "
"I love 5sos I've been here since 2013 and never plan on leaving the boys. They are my 
Sunshine's cliche but its true. Their albums just keep getting better and 
better!! "
"Everything about this album is amazing 5 seconds of summer puts out an amazing vibe that will make you feel good. 
All of these songs are completely beautiful and you can tell that they put 
so much work into their music. They try and make music that can relate to 
their fans and so far they did a really good jobs. Alot of these songs have 
so much emotion in them, I recommend invisible, catch fire, broke home, the 
girl who crys wolf, and broken home. This album really shows,not how only 
they grew as people but how they grew as song writers. "
"Im so excited! I love these boys to pieces! They have help me though so much and im so 
proud of them. I have watched them grow up and I just love them! The names 
are very interesting and I can wait to hear them! Im so proud of these 4 
dorks "
":( I'm sad I don't get to listen to it since my parents wouldn't let me 
preorder or even buy the album.. but I know it's going to be amazing so 
5star anyway! :) "
"I love it ... I love it even though I've only heard like 4 songs but yeah. And I also 
can't listen to Jet black heart yet so MICHAEL, YOU ARE A LIAR "
"5SOS IS LYFE I can't wait for this album, it'll be a new sound to their normal stuff. 
Same them, just a little more powerful messages. Ashton said he's never 
been proud of anything else, so I know the boys love it as much as we will! 
Can't wait! Big fan, much love "
"Amazing Im so glad I found these boys. They saved my life. I was going through a 
really rough time and they where there to support me with there music. It 
means a lot to me. So I suggest you buy this album! "
"These four boys ❤ Can't believe its their second album already, just from what I've heard so 
far I can tell this is going to be an amazing album. Love these four boys 
so much!!!! ❤ "
"BUY THE SH*T OUT OF THIS ALBUm If you disagree, you are wrong. This album is golden. No doubt about it. 
*drops mic* "
"I love 5sos!!!!!!!!! I have 3 different favorite songs and they are permanent vacation and jet 
black heart and then money. I would have pre-ordered the album but I'm 
broke and my mom probably wouldn't let me so. "
"Fly Away Can't wait! This album is going to be fantastic. Only problem - I thought 
Fly Away was supposed to download if you pre-order the album... It hasn't 
happened yet "
"OMFG! I cried! They r so talented. Its like all the problems I have the have 
written a song about. My heart. The feels. Michael's solos. Luke's solos. 
Ashton's solos. Calum's solos. Wow. "
"They have improved so much! They have grown up! I love them! They have 
either as much as made people laugh to big things like saving peoples 
lives! They have made me laugh smile and cry! There music is so amazing! 
They have made me emotional from there music as well <3 I love them! "
"To:5 Seconds Of Summer I might never get the album but i hope i do but if i don't u guys should 
know you are the best band in my life you guys are great at what u do just 
follow your heart and do what is best for you thank u for becoming a band 
and never break up i will not knock on wood before i jinx it thank u guys 
for everything i love you -Falisha xoxo "
"I LOVE 5SOS theyre just great in general. i haven't bought sgfg yet, but i will 
eventually. i love them so much i cant even explain it :-))) 
#weloveyoumichael "
"I'm screaming RIGHT NOW! Oh my GAWD YES, IT'S HERE AND I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO PRE ORDER IT FOR 
SURE! "
"I love them so much I can't even begin to explain how proud I am of these 4 boys, they've come 
so far and I can't be any happier. Keep conquering the world boys x "
"Album is Great - One Problem I pre-ordered the album and despite the e-mail I received, saying my order 
was on hold, it still displayed that the album was available. I realized to 
listen to it, I had to get the free trial subscription. Now, it says I have 
to buy it again. What happened? "
"AMAZING But...... I feel so sorry for the people in the comments who don't have 
money on there phone to buy this I have a £25 voucher on my phone and £50 
on my ipod for my birthday I've got £110 and I've only spent £10 of it so 
omg I'm so lucky "
"Beautiful!! I loved this! Great melodies and beats you can dance to. Very sexy and 
fun! "
"Love it I give her 5 stars because I love her and I love all her songs and its 
amazing "
ASAP The song with asap is just amazing. Asaps rap in it is class too! Wow 
"Can't keep my hands off this album, my hands off this album dun dun... ...I mean I could but why would I want to "

Best eveeerrr 
"Not as good as Love Songs, Drug Songs. X Ambassadors are the kind of bands that I'd want to see in concert more 
often, especially after hearing their last album. However, this album has 
the ""VHS"" segments in the album (7 total) that can drag on for too long in 
my opinion. The rest of the music is decent at best, except the obvious 
hits that captured the world by storm. VHs Is an album that any fan of X 
Ambassadors will enjoy, but not as much as I did with ""Love Songs, Drug 
Songs."" "
"X Ambassadors is So happy this album is finally out, I'd like to thank Imagine Dragons for 
having XA as their opening act in San Jose 2014. They're going to blow up 
with this album, music is so raw and original must listen "
"X Ambassadors In my opinion, Fear is tHE BEST SONG OF ALL TIME!!! That was the best 
colab in the history of ever and I just can't get over Imagine Dragons AND 
X Ambassadors!! TOGETHER!!! But overall their whole album is flipping 
awesome. "
"Renegade I really dont know any of the other songs but LOVE THE SONG RENEGADE i 
could listen to it all day. I like listening to it before i read a book 
because for the book im reading its a good song to have stuck in your head. "
"Fantastic Such a solid album. Great lyrics and a really different sound. It has been 
a long time since I have heard music like this that I enjoy to listen to 
whenever. These guys deserve to blow up and get huge. "
"VHS Almost a year later and this album is still as good as if it just came 
out. Fear is one of my favorite songs because it features Imagine Dragons. 
I love where X ambassadors are heading with their albums with the catchy 
lyrics and unbeatable beats. :) 5 stars all the way! "
"Holy crap! Lead singer has one of those voices that only comes along every few 
decades. He could win a Grammy just by singing the phone book. Unsteady is 
so powerful, full of meaning and power. "
"X - Ambassadors ""VHS"" Not too much vinyl out there now-a-days that I can 'honestly' say that I 
really liked the whole chip! This is Great! "
"This song is absolutely amazing Not only does this song sound amazing but I heard that the meaning behind 
the song is to celebrate everyone's differences and just to be your self 
basically. X-Ambassadors is awsome "
"♡♡♡ I love almost all the songs. I'm surprised Unsteady is so cheap compared 
to the others, it's one of the best. Even though Renegades is good, I've 
heard it too much and it's kind of boring now. "
"Renagades! I've Been Waiting For A Song Like This From X Ammbassadors Love It I 
Always Play It When I'm Playing Call Of Duty Black Ops 3 Because It Keeps 
Me Focused Thanks For Making This X Ammbassadors Keep Up The Good 
Work!!!♡☆♡ "
"Loved It Awesome album. It's more poppy (popy?) than what I usually listen to but 
it's just such a fun and energetic album that I just have to give it a 5. 
Doesn't the lead singer sound like Freddie Mercury on some of the tracks 
though? "
"❤❤❤ Nothing like small time people becoming future big time stars. Various 
elements and different styles of music all on one album makes you wonder 
what they'll do next. Keep it up "
"Don't know the album But its the first on ur workout $8 ""deal"" and I just wanna say wtf that's 
not a sale "
"Loved it! Absolutely in love with the dyno sound this band creates! Its been a long 
time since music has made my whole body groove and this album does! "
"My new favourite band I feel like i can just relax listening to these guys while i ride my 
roadbike, anything that does that gets a 5 from me "
"Great Album It would work well in Saints Row 4 or that new, Just Cause 3 & Mad Mad 
Video Game . also this album is amazing for video games like the 1 that 
mentioned and granddaughter 5album is amazing for video games like the 1 I 
mentioned like grand theft auto 5. "
"Moving X ambassadors song renegades was really moving, and the video was too. I 
love how the piano player of the band is blind, I think that's a reason 
they made the song. But it's a great song and I think it's gonna be 
remembered "
"X Ambassadors VHS It is simply a great albumn. I was won over by the song Renegade. This 
song was used during last year's surfing season to advertise the new Jeep 
Renegade for WSL. "
"Love this album There are very few albums that I like every song but this has to be my 
favorite out of all of them "
"Personally I loved it My favorites were loveless, Jungle Unsteady, and Renegades. Everything 
else was pretty good too. "
Love this band!!!! These guys are a must to buy! I cried when I first heard renegades. 
"My favorite song its just amazing I love it. i just wish I could have it 
for free but u guys won't give me it "
Loved it But I hated the Interludes 
"Renegades It's a party in song you feel uplifted and happy when you listen to it 
there's more to this song than just a title there's friend ships and good 
times with memories being made "
"Renegade Love driving and playing renegade song in my Jeep..but would play it in 
any car .. "
"Renegades Easy to follow....kind of music you could play at a backyard BBQ or 
cruising back country. Just like the song. "
"I listened to it a few times and, well, hucfhivhfshfdkkhh refojjn 
ljjddhcgsjjvnddjvh kjddvjljjddfcgjjjnejfjgcbvfojdfnfbjojh!!!!!! Totally loved it. ;-) "
"BEST SONG EVER!!!! :D I listen to this song almost every time I take a shower, and sonetimes I 
listen to it when I play minecraft. (-: "
"Love the song makes me feel like that feeling u get when u believe u can do 
anything and not be scared and believe in your self "
"Google play music Half of the songs won't load and I bought a song and it won't show up in 
my library so I can't use it as a ring tone or anything. "
Awesome Loved the whole theme. Every song is well written. Love these guys 
"RENEGADES IS A PERFECT SONG I find renegades great for driving on a freeway and you're going past the 
countryside everything just fits perfectly "
Been a long time since I bought an entire album! 
"Hell Yesss!! Absolutely fantastic!! I look forward to seeing you guys really getting 
your names out there! "
Wow Didn't expect to hear something this good. 
"LOVE IT This album is amazing and so happy my friend showed me their songs cause 
now I'm obessesed "
I bought renegades and it the sound will go in and out 
Such a good album If you like music you will enjoy 90% of the songs on this album 
GREATNESS This album is just magnificent! Every single song is absolutely amazing! 
"AMAZING As the name suggests, the album takes the listener on a journey through 
the several real stories based on real people. Ne-Yo once again proves he 
is the best. "
"Amazing Love the concept and all songs. Although I believe he could've chosen the 
singles better. "
Sean Brennan

on your music as well! but I can tell u r doing the best u can considering 
all that u have been thru. u have handled it very well! WELL DONE!!!!! :) "
"Knows what we want everytime Every song that comes out of him is tops (gold)! I think his lovin's 
Miranda is bringing the best in him. He probably would do just as good on 
his own, but, the love of a good woman seems bring out a little more 
somehow. Blake, keep the love alive and the songs will keep coming. "
"Based on my Story chew tobacco spit This Guy I am loving causing he is so much like my friends from the 
Bronx..""Manly Men""...it's a guy thing,""Live a good life b a guy "
"Great!!! Blake has a way of saying what so many more of us want to. He does it in a 
way that either makes you laugh or agree very strongly. I love Blake's 
music. Let's hope he keeps this up for a long time. "
"Amazing talent! I really don't think Blake could make a bad song all of em are great! He 
makes great songs for ever emotion happy, sad, hell raisin, and everyone 
in-between! All around a super great guy and very nice down to earth guy 
when ya meet him....oh an beautiful eyes! :) "
"Good I usually don't like country music but Blake Shelton is one of my favorite 
artists ever. He's so good, this album deserves 10 stars. "
"Just love that boys out here. Then says chew tabco chew tabaco. I hate 
chewing tabaco thing but its sounds cool. Oh my son chews @ allso sings. He 
sp unds just like or even better .Allso my oldest son plays drums 
Awwwwwwsom... "
"Based on a True Story Old farts???? Give it up, Blake. We have more interest in good music.And 
have the money to buy. Be careful who you warm up to... "
"I love everything about this album, and Blake is just So Man, Sexy, down 
right just so Witty and just love him and Miranda. I would say Ditto to all 
the other reviews that the two of them have made each other better. What 
has come out from both of them since been together has been incredible, 
their Talent has doubled, tripled in these past years. They were definitely 
met to be together the Awards they have both won amazing. I love them both 
and this Album has his Best on it. Love love. "
"Base on a true story I love blake shelton no matter if he's not married to mariannda any more 
or not. He's good by his- self he doesn't need a women stand beside him to 
make him look good, lord he's already that!!!. I love you blake, Sara from 
Texas. "
"Based On A True Story Blake is just a""Bad Mother Shut Your Mouth"".That man is awesome everything 
out of his mouth comes out and who wouldn't want lay next to Miranda every 
night Blake your my her "
"True country boy Greatest country artist ever! When you look at and listen to Blake Shelton 
country doesn't get any better than that..... "
"Just one problem Track 5 eyes will not play, please fix the problem "
"Best country music singer today period. Funny too Same as above, every song is awesome, just buy it because I said so :') "
"Blake has done it again! Great compilation of songs and featured artists. Blake himself is 
fantastic and doesn't need any help making his music country strong!! "
"HE IS AWSOME I REALLY WANT TO MEET HIM HELLO BLAKE SHELTON AND IM 10 YEARS 
OLD AND MY NAME IS LOGAN BLAKE DRUMMOND IM A BIG FAN MY FAMILY JUST LOVES 
HIM BUT I THINK YOU,ERIC CHURCH,BRAD PAISLEY, LUKE BRYAN,kenny Chesney,tim

"Based on a true story This cd has everything you want! It's soft, exciting, loving it is the 
best arrangement I've heard from Blake so far! Love it!!!!! "
"Min would be you. It remains me of the woman,I Loved with all my heart. TANYA LYNN CARTER. I

"I found someone! Been through hell with past, telling that person it's finally over and

Hunter Redding union country for live go tigers This is what real music is not all of that rap and head banging music.

"ONE OF MY FUTURE NEXT HUSBANDS I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED BLAKES MUSIC....BUT THIS ALBUM BY FAR IS THE BEST HES 
RELEASED!!! AWESOME!!! I FOUND SOMEONE EXPLAINS MY WHOLE PAST YEAR OF MY 
LIFE!!! ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "
Blake Shelton Blake has become known to me from the voice.I fell in love.. 
:D Blake is the best thing that could ever happen since FGL and Luke Bryan. 
"all around great humanbein , didn 't liked it loved it give that boy a five star+ gosh darnit "
"caitlin piercy all of blake sheltons songs are the best i love you so much you are my 
favorite song writer ever never stop singing country songs "
"A real man True heart Blake.....you are the best of the best....please do more music 
with Trace Adkins "
"Blake Shelton Its fun I've never really been a listener b4 BT I don't mind this can sit 
bk an have a few "
"Based on a true story Loved it could listen to his music all day and nite he has a wonderful 
great voice he is an angle in disguise. "
"They killed every beat in every song. So thats what I most liked about this 
album. They had lots of different artist in this so that probably helped 
them in music wise. Both Chris & Tyga did there parts really well so hats 
off to both them. Chris Brown & Tyga worked really well 2gether on this 
album so they should try make another album together. My personal favorite 
was AYO. "
"Dope AF Best album I'm big huge, large fan of Chris And Tyga and I'm really proud 
of all the work and effort they put in to fan of a fan 2 they are definetly 
brothers for another mother. Music by themselves is really dope but 
together they are unstoppable, Chris has a dope tone of voice, and Tyga has 
amazing Rap skills, they really deserve credit and 5 stars. I actually hope 
for more hit songs from both of them , individually and together "
"Amazing The kings of music... This album is so great. It provides amazing beats 
and lyrics. You can tell they worked there buts off for this. They have 
something good happening here. Disserves everything,a Grammy,a moon 
man,EVERYTHING.. love you guys alot "
"Tyga. You done boi. Tyga is trash man. I'm sorry but he been corny since that wack coconut 
song. If it wasn't for white dudes tryna be hood or bitches who are thots 
and don't know real hip hop, he would be a local rapper and that's it. "
"Fan Of A Fan The Album (Chris Brown) Chris Brown has got some Talant he has to be my faverate male solo artest 
people have alot to say about him but i always say there's always two 
side's to every story critic's i can't stand um all critic's are just all 
jelous T★★T's! Well i say you keep doing what your doing Chris lad your 
doing a fine Job... "
"Bumpin album! Big ups to my boy Chris Brown showing off an additional 
talent and Tyga holdin it down. My favorite song is wrong in the right way 
Chris 1st verse is an all time favorite of mine. This I will be playing for 
years to come just like I still play the hot tracks from past years. 
Congratulations on a fun album!! "
"Good beats... but very rapey vibe The flow and beats of the songs are beyond excellent, but the lyrics are 
borderline childish. Its really an album about Breezy and Tyga getting 
girls in the most ridiculous ways. They believe alcohol and pot will get 
them with any girl. I wish they used the lyrics in more original way, but 
it sounds like a bunch of 17 year olds fantasizing about getting in bed 
with everyone and anyone. "
"Fan of a Fan!!! Love it, love Tyga and Chris Brown both great artist. They did it with the 
collaboration, on this Album. This is most definitely sum that you can turn 
up too in the club!!!! Great work guys keep going hard, Fan of a Fan "
"Fan of a Fan Shows diversity the rhythm and blues side of it sizzles with a hint of 
raunchy and sexy igniting your primal desire for a bit of naughty play and 
fun while the hip hop keeps you fully charged with adrenaline massive beats 
charm the hidden dancer and rapper that lives in us all. Loved this one as 
much as the first collaborative. "
"Perfect blend of singing and rap Even though Tyga is average at best, CB carried more than enough weight 
with solid features to make this an awesome listen all the way into the 
summer. Banjo, Nothin' Like Me or Bunkin' will be in a nightclub near you! "
"Masterpiece Awesome collaboration...both Breezy and Tyga really brought unique talents 
to the table. This album in general has got er'thing; old-school, some 
funky, cali style and RnB slow type joints. Dope. "
":/ Seriously ?!? The beats are on point. I'm ACTUALLY LISTENING to what 
you're saying- the gist of this album is drugs, money, girls and girls and 
girls. A whole lot of nothing was said on this album... I'm sticking to 
Drake. "
"THIS ALBUM IS FIRE!!! Man I wish I never overlooked this album otherwise I would have been 
bought it a long time ago. I have this album on REPEAT almost everyday. 
This album is definitely better than the mixtape in all forms. Both clean 
and explicit versions are good but I had to go with this one cause it's 
uncensored. Awesome job love the album the beats and the collaboration is 
one of the best. My favorite song is She Goin' Up. Epic "
"I liked it but I thought the last mixtape they did together was fire. This album I really 
liked only 5 tracks on the album. Could been better, thought it was Lil 
rushed. "
"Two People Who's Music Blends Perfectly Tyga and Chris Brown are two of my favorite hip-hop artists. I love Tyga's 
flow, and the way he can go in on a song, and he makes really great covers 
on top of it. Then Chris Brown has really good vocals for the slower songs, 
and is also a pretty good rapper. These two have very similar styles, so 
they blend quite well. I'm looking forward to Fan of a Fan 2, if it ever 
releases. Great album. "
"Killed It Chris Brown is an amazing R&B artist. He's so talented. In my opinion, 
this album sounds SOOOOOOO much better, with him on it. I love Tyga. He and 
Breezy go perfectly together. Chris, you'll always be my favorite singer, 
R&B artist, everything! You're an amazing person. Don't stop, because it'll 
only get better and better, I know it. Love ya! "
"what happened Ayo is probably the only Good song on here and I only like the chorus. On 
that note WHAT IN THE HELL happened to Chris brown, back then he had really 
awesome songs I actually had a crush on him. But not anymore his music went 
to hell after 2012. "
"Just why??? Tyga and chris aint bad but cmon they just keep makin songs that sound the 
exact same its always hoes this and that.....wish the old breezy was back

same song like three times. But overall it's cool though. "

"Tyga messed it all the way up Chris Brown didnt disappoint us but Tyga really tries too hard it was wack 
n weak...this should of just been chris brown album "
"Killed It.... Not Really into tyga but him and Chris together can bring it....Chris is 
extremely talented anything he is featured on with his voice he makes 
anything song better with him on it(my opinion) no one can take that away 
from him my favorite song on the album Wrong in the right way Chris killed 
it..... "
"XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX I didnt think this album was gonna be good at all. I think its safe to say 
i was wrong, its pretty good! "
"Music This is great motivation to use my voice and sing my heart out. Bow weezy 
I love you:) "
"The most epic album I've ever heard in my life, mixing the right old skool 
influences of incredible rap with sick beat and unforgettable lyrics! "
"Fun They're just talking about sex and money and weed, but you can tell 
they're having fun. It's a fun, nasty album. "
"Hmmm I liked it but didn't love it. It is still a good album s/o to Tyga And 
Breezy "
3 tracks outta 16 #fail Not worth downloading! Drake mixtape kills their album lol 
"Rubbish Ayo sounds exactly the same as Loyal, the songs have good beats but very 
immature and irritating lyrics. "

"Drake drops a suprise MIXTAPE . didnt promote anything and has better 
numbers then this Album that they been talking about since 2013. they fell 
off bad. smh "
"Its a good album for ppl who like to dance, I would consider it 
like...""thot music"" which I'm not a fan of but on this album they had some 
good songs like remember me, ayo,better and lights out. "
"I don't know What to Say this I don't like You're songs because They are Pretty Bad but. I like You're 
song called Bang Bang ft. Ariana Grande & Nicki and Flashlight but Not the 
Rest of Them because They are pretty Bad because They have some Badwards in 
It ""Tho!"" but I will Hear the Rest That are um Very Good ""tho!"" "
"Amazing Definitely one of the best albums of the year! Jessie J's vocals are just 
so majestic and the musicality behind the voice just makes everything even 
better! The title track ""Sweet Talker"" produced by Diplo caught me by 
surprise, Just laid back and refreshing! "
"Awesome! I absolutely love this album. Definitely her best. I feel like it has a 
much better flow than her last, like there was one solid idea throughout. 
And her voice is incredible! "
"Favourite singer Jessie J is becoming my favourite singer. Her vocal abilities are 
unparalleled and then, she also writes her own music. Every song on this 
album is special and perfect in their own way. It is one of very few albums 
I can listen to in its entirety without skipping any songs "
"I like to listen to all of Jessie j songs are very awesome and supreme 
singer and she is a good looking woman and she is very awesome and amazing 
singer anyway too. I like to listen to all of Jessie j songs are very awesome and amazing

together though, this is an amazing album. Keep up the good work :) "
"A piece of great music. I literally love whole her. No doubts I love this album, too! Jessie J is 
my favorite female singer so far. "

"Best Album Best Band\m/ I've been a Fooies fan for many years now and the greatest hits album was 
my first album of theirs. They are simply amazing and live they just blow 
you away. The most amazing moment was seeing them on my birthday Dec 8th 
2011, I'll never forget that day it truly made me a live long fan of them. 
Buy this album and if you haven't seen them live DO IT!!!!!!!! You won't 
regret or forget the experience\m/ "
"A showcase album of a modern great! Very rarely does an album's tracklist have you announcing ""Chooon!!"" out 
loud on reading each song down the list...this album, however, smashes that 
mould to smithereens with a sledge hammer and with devil horns aloft!! 
Bathe in a plethora of musical genius again and again as one hit follows 
another in a rollercoaster ride, showcasing the neck tingling power, 
passion and glory of one of the most consistently great bands of the last 
two decades! "
"EVery PERSON MUST HAVE THIS CD. WHoLly - THIS CD IS OMG! RAW, REAL, AND LOVELY AT THE SAME TIME. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
A++++++++++++ MAJOR SOUL BABY JAM N RELEASE! PLEASE COME BACK TO DFW OR 
ANYWHERE CLOSE ENUFF TO DRIVE - WE WILLIAM HAUL OUR FOO FIGHTER BUTTS 
THERE! I PROMISE! "
"True Alternative If you've heard these guys on album, that's how they sound live. They 
record live and how they sound is how they sound. No crazy effects. No 
voice editing. How true alternative should be. Not to mention all around 
greatness "
"Love it love it love it I am a huge fan of them and was so happy they put it up I downloaded it 
straight away and I can't tell you how many times I've played it! Let's 
just say its more than I can count! "
"Good album but DONT BUY FROM GOOGLE Pain in the neck to find the files then when you do they don't have 
correct song titles. DON'T BUY FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE, IT'S CRAP! "
"Excellent music This whole album is mind blowimg. I listen to the whole thing; every song 
is excellent. EPIC. Truly.Makes me feel great and satisfies my need for 
loud raging rock!!! "
"F.F. does it again I have Wasting Light, but sometimes I wonder why I didn't get this album - 
listening to 'All My Life' as I write this - I knew most of the words when 
I was 6! "
"Wheels Foo Fighters I know what you're thinkin' We were goin' down I can feel the 
sinkin' But then i came around And everyone I've loved before Flashed 
before my eyes And nothin' matterd any more I looked into the sky Well we 
all somthing better than We wish for somthing new Well,you wanted something 
better than Wished for something true Been lookin' for a reason and 
Something to lose When the wheels come down When the wheels touch ground 
And you feel like its all over There's another round for you Whe "
"Best of the best Honestly Foo fighters is my favorite band. Not only do they write 
meaningful music, they are so talented. Plus I've seen them live and Dave 
Grohl sounds exactly as the records...truly amazing! "
"Better than Nirvana Although I love Nirvana (They are in my top 5)! I have to admit The Foo 
Fighters are a better band! When Dave Group sings you know he puts his 
whole soul I to! I believe they are the only great band that is currently 
active! They never fade keep winning those Grammys boys! "
"Greatest hits albums are rarely this great From pop simplicity to syncopated rhythmical weirdness, these guys truly 
capture mass appeal. I mean, they are simply massively appealing. "
"Very simple I love the style of this band and how actually all of their songs are the 
same song but with different lyrics, they know how to make awesome musoc 
with only a pair of chords, that's is what for me, this is the best band in 
the whole world "
"Foo fighters greatest hits Brilliant compilation of their greatest hits, each one I find myself 
singing along to and rocking my head! "
"I'm a hip hop/grime scene guy, but yeah Foo fighters are pretty much the only people who have been able to 
consistently make songs I rate, without being rappers because I just have 
never found interest in anywhere other than hip hop other than grunge. "
"Learned To Fly Maybe knowing how awesome the video is influenced my opinion... but this 
song just plain ole rocks! <3 "
"Cooler than cool I won't listen to stupid Jon Wilson he chose a very stupid agreement so 
everyone listen to me and not Jon "
"A must have album for any rock fan. This album does exactly what it says on the cover,it delivers hit song 
after hit song great sounding rock music that delivers the goods. "
"I have 3 CDs of them! Awesome album if you like loud music. (Nirvana, Offspring, and Creed etc) "
"Awesome One of the best greatest hits compilations around. I never tire of 
listening to the Foo's, each song sounds fresh every time. "
"FOO FIGHTERS Greatest live performances....it blows ure mind from track all the way 
thru!!! Great energy from a Great band !'' "
"Rock by numbers Probably the best band in the world at making regular rock songs that 
basically are all the same but with different lyrics. Start quiet, get 
louder, quiet bit again then loud to fade. Nothing special. "
"Better than most Good but they need to try to be different than everyone else. They sound 
like nickelback for now. Still ok to listen to. "
Pearl Jam/All my life Awesome! Rock it when uve had a bad day 
"Tracklist There's so many great songs on this cd its worth getting if you don't have 
any of their albums "
"HANDS DOWN--THE BEST BAND OF THE PAST 2 DECADES!!!! Thank you Dave 
Grohl...You're MY HERO!!! (And hopefully my next ex-husband! !) LOL "
Good album by a great band It's kind of scary to say this was kind of a disappointment 
"Foo fighter fan If you are going to buy any of there albums buy this it includes one of my 
favorite songs all my life and the pretender "
"Best album ever! ONLY 2 POUNDS. Wow for an amazing album like this!!! And 'all my life' is 
free!!! For as little as 2 quid, this is worth every penny if not more. My 
favourite band and one of my favourite albums "
"Foo Fighters Definitely one of the most solid best of any band albums of All time. A 
classic. "
