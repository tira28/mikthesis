"4.5. $+@Rs!! Her album is full of lyrics which flow off her lips with all the passion, 
anger, idealism, scars and hubris of untamed youth. The lyrics convey a 
quality of self truth which come from experiences not easily endured yet 
universal to coming of age. Certainly the explicit language is there, but I 
find it genuine and not forced. 4.5 stars and not more is mainly due in 
part to be a challenge for her as she matures poetically as musician and 
entertainer for her next album. I'm looking forward to more! "
"Amazing! Although every song is great, I recommend Castle, Haunting, Gasoline, and 
Control. Can't wait to hear more from her! "
The beast Halsey hot great and has the best voice I have ever heard. 
"First time saw her opening up for Imagine Dragons in Boston, she was 
awesome! I want her to ""hold me captive with her kiss"" haha hope to meet ya 
Halsey! "
"Halsey is a goddess She is so creative with her lyrics, like I legit die everytime one of her 
songs come on. "
"I love Halsey Her songs are amazing they make you want to dance and sing.She's just an 
amazing person.I want people to start listening to her you will love her. 
I'm a new fan I started liking her about 2 weeks ago. "
"I'm so proud I've been following Halsey since her tumblr days and now she's going to 
release an album I'm so proud of her "
"Love her!!! I've just got really into halsey latley and she is one of my favorite 
artists. Her lyrics are meaningful and her voice gives me chills. I highly 
recommend her "
Halsey the whOLE ALBUM IS SO FREAKING AMAZING MY BBY GIRL DID IT 
"The thing is her name is my name and i found out she was alternative indie 
so i listened to her all amazing everthing about her "
"IM.SCREMAINB okay okay i was like 10 seconds into Castle and i was like omg omg this is 
beautiful. I domt have any moemy so i will buy it later "
"!!!!!!!!! I love Halsey so much and almost don't want this playing everywhere I go. 
Although that would be pretty cool. But the way she sings and the 
meaningful lyrics make her music personal for every listener and I think 
that's something special. But also, this is amazing stuff and everyone 
needs to hear it! "
"This album completely blew me away! I don't think there's one song on it 
that I am not in love with. Completely perfect!! "
"Listen. This eminem will never be back. If you knew anything. Eminem had to 
basicly reteach himself how to rap again after he was in a choma from 
overdosing. Yeah this em is awesome. But the new em is even better because 
hes rapping like he is in rap god while hes sober. Em will always be 
awesome. "
"Yes Yes I don't listen to rap that much but this guy was like what I listen to 
every morning on the way to school I love his music no doubt. "
"amazing After buying this on my ipod I lost my ipod forgot the itunes password got 
a new phone bought the whole album again lost my sd card and my password to 
my Google account bought this album again a new phone (the one I have now) 
what I'm saying is this is one of the greatest albums ever "
"Best Album This is Eminem at his finest! I brought everything to the table on this 
album. Any album after this was not that great including his new album 
MMLP2. Everyone I know wants this eminem back again. Plus he needs to work 
more with DRE "
"Dopest Superman & Collapse make this a top 5 all time rap album no doubt, black, 
white, purple, fuggetaboutit... dopest "
"Brilliant Album This is a very good album!! Till I collapse is probably the best pump up 
song ever "
"Best album Favorite album of all time Eminem never put out a bad album encore was a 
little wacky but was still good this album is simply the best if you 
haven't heard this yet then you don't know good music "
"THE BEST ALBUM HE HAS EVER RELEASED This is by far the greatest material he has ever released. I enjoyed every 
single song and you will too. Even the clean version stands up with the 
sounds instead of the cussing. Must have "
"Perfect Eminem's most diverse album, its got sad, happy, angry, funny and 
inspirational songs all done during his peak... No matter style kind of 
Eminem songs you prefer you will love this album "
"A must. Best rap album of all time in my opinion. Only thing that comes close is 
Jay-z's black album. Unbelievable lyrics throughout establishing Eminem as 
a true hip hop superstar rather then a white mainstream pop act. A 
masterpiece. "
"Great Album, Learn to use Google It's NOT stream only, as some have posted. Open your Android music player 
(stock) and make sure ""offline music only"" is UNchecked under settings. Now 
find this album under Albums-> and select ""make available offline"". This 
will download the album to your device. Once you purchase it, it's made 
available to your 'cloud' and you have to manually download it to your 
physical device. Or use the Music manager to download to your computer. 
This is the best quality you will get at 320kbps "
"Yep so.... First review, seriously? whining about a musicians ""making a ton of money"" 
(because they should all work for free?) and the money going to drugs and 
partying? Better stop listening to any music genre anywhere ever 
then....great album of you like Eminem. Google works fine if you're smarter 
than the inanimate objects (ie hardware/software) in your hand. Complaints 
are posted by people who are neither. Either you like him or you don't. If 
you do, you'll like this one too. "
"A Moving Album I bought my first Eminem album deep in the bible belt of rural Indiana. I 
was probably 13 or 14. My mother had sent me from my vibrant and liberal 
home state of California to live with my grandmother for the summer. The 
culture shock was resonating; I had gone from being a normal 
guy--shoulder-length hair, baggy pants, and a ripped hoodie--to being a 
pariah outcast. This combination of teen angst and social isolation is 
probably what drove me to buy this album, since Eminem was all over the 
media at that time, being labeled with every negative adjective imaginable. 
I figured we were the same. Well, we weren't. After buying this album and 
listening to it all summer, I returned to California a changed child. I 
will forever remember this album as the bell that heralded my awakening to 
the realities of the world. With deeply emotional songs like Cleanin' Out 
My Closet, about his painful childhood and the tumultuous relationship with 
his mother, and Hailie's Song, about his overwhelming love for his daughter 
and his promise to give her a good life, it's difficult not to be moved by 
Eminem's work. The interludes, brief sequences of raw emotional content, 
are just as powerful. Buy it. "
"Don't give 1 star b/c phone too full to download Except for 1 person, who seemed to truly dislike the music, every review 
rating this album 1 star is from a person unable to find the download (try 
using search, duh!); 1-2 songs that won't play properly; & 1 ditz blaming 
Google & giving 1 star review b/c his/her device hasn't enough space to 
download? Except for ditz, & the proper subjective 1 star, all other 
disgruntleds need to contact Google Play Store. This space is where you 
rate the music; if you've tech problems, call support! Arggh! "
"Another mind blower Em has totally killed it on his 3rd album. This is definitely in his top 
3. He has some amazingly strong lyrics, good beats, and a nice flow (as 
usual). As soon as u start the album and white America starts playing u'll 
know that Ems ready to pump some great rhymes into your ears. I don't think 
anything's touched mmlp, but ANYTHING is better than Encore. Just because 
he raps like he does on rap God now doesn't me we can't listen to his 
classics. "
"Best Album This album combines both the serious and silly sides of Eminem in the best 
way. It's very solid. If you're on the fence about Eminem, this is the 
album to choose sides with. "
"Sing for the Moment This is the ONLY song i like from him. The lyrics make since and are 
actully slick. Rarly heard him swear (swearing just kills it all lack of 
creativity) and the whole song comes into play. Best in my opinion "
One of the best Not as great as recovery but still a great album! 
"Excellent Album Love the beats by Dre , love the lyrical talent. Em's having fun and 
making rap look easy. Some classic songs that will be remembered for years 
to come. "
"Amazing The best of Eminem I hope his album this year is as good cause its his 
last. It's gonna suck when he is gone. No one will ever be able to match 
him. He is a musical genius. "
"Perfection. Simply said, this album is a banger from second one until the very last. 
This is a stellar record all the way through. Not one track gets skipped 
when I listen, I rock every track on it; sometimes twice. Em is quite 
easily the most prolific and skilled rapper there is in this watered-down, 
auto tuned, noddy era for rap/hip hop. EXCELLENT. ""'Til I Collapse"" is one 
of my top 10 faves of ALL TIME and I usually listen to 90's alt & sleepy, 
indie synth-type stuff so... Get it. Nuff said. "
DA best rapper ever Eminem is my favorite rapper I love all his albums I give it 6 stars 
"Dont be hatin fool If you going to hate, hate on your self fool!!! Eminem is the best! "
Incomplete It gave me incomplete songs i want fefunded too bad i love this album 
"Nice This is a really good album. How can any one complain about this album? 
When you guys blew a korean artist up. Whats this world coming to? "
"Stupid music for stupid people. I can't believe I used to listen to this 
crap. "
"I've played this whole album about a million times since I was like 13-14. 
I'm now 25 & it's still one of my favorites. A classic all the way through "
"BEST F**KIN ALBUM EVER All the songs sound like hits. hands down , one of his best albums. FAV 
song (Till I Collapse) "
":-(( I'm a BIG BIG EMINEM FAN and this is one of my favorite cd's, but two of 
my songs are cut off or cut into and I'm very upset about so I'm only 
giving 3 stars!!!! "
"Read this Fix it.I cant listen to my music Without Me and i bought it.It keeps on 
saying no space ablelive.If u Guys fix it ill rate back to 5 stars "
"Greatness This is easily one of the best albums over all time in any genre. You owe 
it to yourself to listen to it, because it very rarely gets any better than 
this. "
"Stfu lil kid The kid that said watch it on youtube stfu nobody cares if they like him 
let em buy it to support him. Who tf cares what he spends it on. "
"Can't download I purchased it and I've tried looking through my settings in both my music 
players that are stock and couldn't find anything to help. How can I 
download this album since I already bought it? Once done I'll give 5 stars. "
My favorite I love your mind you spoke through the walls of my soul. Bobbi L. Coglizer 
"Amazing Follow me on sound cloud big_j_raps I'm just starting but tell me what 
yall think and tell your friends about me "
"He's the best I don't listen to anyone else when it comes to music like this its him or 
nothing at all "
"Beezneez !! Best album I ever purchased. One of those that you can let play without 
skipping to the next track on repeat.. "
"EPIC!!! He was the reason I started listening to rap more often, can really relate 
to his lyrics! "
"Eminem is great He's following his dreams so he drunk most of the people are drunk when 
there singing hes great I love him I want to be him when I grow "
"Marshall's Legacy This is what Em win be remembered for in years to come. One of my favorite 
albums of all time. "
"wickedly talented Phenomenal !!! Love idina so much and the fact that she's brought out a 
Christmas album makes me love her even more hahaha defos buy this album 
guys "
"Love her! I love her voice. Let It Go is a great song, and I'm talking about Idina's 
version. This album is just perfect, I gave it 5 stars because she's a 
great artist (and again the album is perfect). I'm so buying this for 
Christmas this year. "
"Idina Menzel is perfection! From ""Let It Go"" to this, her voice is beautiful and now in a full 
Christmas album. "
"Amazing Idina Menzel as such an amazing voice and her voice brings something more 
magical to these Christmas songs! "

bring the album down a bit but a great easy listening one! "
"Buble' Fan This album is.....I don't even have words for it. Unreal. Of course her 
duet with Michael Buble' is my favorite!! There is no other voice like

is remarkable! "

"An old voice and a young body You know the cliche about singers who are so good they could sing the 
phone book and make it listenable? Well, George Ezra is definitely one of 
those. This 21-year-old Englishman sounds so much like an American bluesman 
in his 60s, it's unreal. He sings, ""Did I send a shiver down your spine? I 
do it all the time."" I couldn't put it better! Highly recommended. "
"Cute guy + Powerful voice = Perfection I absolutely love him he's really 
good at his work and to all of you who gave him 1 star, jealousy never 
solves anything "
"Such a breath of fresh air What an amazing album, I can't believe George is only 21, his songs 
suggest a maturity way beyond his years. Great voice, lots of feeling, 
smart lyrics, what more could you want? This guy is a real treasure! "
"Seriously? I love George, lovely lad with such a beautiful personality and face haha 
but he really doesn't deserve the 1 stars... he has such fantastic music 
and shouldn't be blamed for his music not being available in a country. I 
can't wait for the album finally!! "
"Soothes the soul Heard the song budapest on the radio yesterday and instantly connected 
with his voice. Just had to have the album! "
"Great voice. Refreshing mind. Beautiful work. Powerful voice and touching lyrics with all the little story telling it's 
really, really hard to believe this guy is only 21. He has a long way to 
go. And I wish there are more awesome work from this guy. "
"Brilliant How anyone can rate this 1 star amazes me he's great, just cause it isn't 
available in ur country doesn't mean u should rate ut one star. Jeez! He's 
a great artist and plus super cute! "
"Powerful Voice + Powerful Lyrics Amazing musician, heartfelt music, lyrics and his voice really puts that 
across ;) "
Beast songs ever Amazing love him so much and so cheap 
"Amazing voice Can't stop listening to him. Think he needs to sing a few johnny cash 
songs. Love him. "
"C'mon people & Google! It's not fair to George to give it 1 star just cos you ain't got it in 
your country. Google get your s hit together. "
Blame it on me Love this song n his sexy voice x 
"Budapest, blame it on on me, cassy'O, and riot police ma faves! So low I wish mine went that low "
"Eccezionale George Ezra ha molto talento. Ha una voce profonda, una chitarra 
fantastica e le sue canzoni sono originali e molto diverse una dall'altra, 
è impossibile annoiarsi! Questo album non puó mancarvi! "
"Loved it:-) ♥♥ George Ezra so good!!!!! He is only 21 and from Bristol!!! Why do some 
people not like him? They should switch over to disliking one direction! "
Pre ordered! Love this guys voice! He deserves avery bit of support! 
"Powerful Voice Big talent and big voice. What idiot rates him 1 star for a google tech 
issue? "
"Amazing singer could listen to this album all day non stop, think it's a 
bit pathetic people rating it one cause it's not available in their 
country, you can't write a review if you haven't had it "
"DNet Outstanding talent great sounding voice very refreshing compared to usual 
xfactor crap "
"George Good album for a not so big artist. Similar sound for most songs but each 
is unique in its own way. Enjoyable to listen to. "
"I love it I usually listen to it When I am writing my book and it gives me great 
ideas! "
"Cool! I like this song from george more than his other songs but thats me all of 
his songs are amazing I just personally like budapest "
"Love it So upbeat, takes me to back to when I was young and carefree , uplifting 
and refreshing album "
The best He's the man Mark my words. 
"Budapest Omgosh I cannot believe he's only 21yrs old, his voice is amazing! Wow I 
can't wait to see what else this young man produces! "
It's such a good album. It appeals to all ages 
I love George Ezra and I love this bloody album so much!! 
The best album I have heard in my life 
Love George Ezra! Can't wait till his album is available in the US! 
5 stars! Ignore the 1 star ratings! Just buy this now! 
Fghhh I am going well and then we have a great time 
"Brilliant album Rare is it that an artist has such a smooth and distinct tone. Beautifully 
crafted songs and a must - have album "
I have this album on dick and on my phone I love this album to bits 
Wanted On Voyage George Ezra: talented - young/old - good singer/musician 
Awesome Love it got it stuck in my head 
"This is an amazing album! I heard Budapest on the radio, and had to hear 
more. I took a chance & bought this album. MORE THAN WORTH IT!!! "
THE BOMB He has an amazing voice and is super cute! 
YES Actual decent music makes a return to the 21st century! 
"Surprisingly fantastic As a heavy rock fan I never thought I would like this album but it is 
massively addictive. "
How do I gt it in to my music player it wud b 5* if it went in on its own. 
"Great Album Really enjoy all songs not just Em's(His songs are the best though). Can't 
wait to see what these guys will do in the future. "
"Great album Not amazing, but still a very good album with great hip hop beats and 
rhymes. "
"Good Album but Em's Albums are always good I've gave it 4 out of 5 as some of the songs aren't as good as Em's other 
Albums but there's sum really good tunes on this album. Ray C.F.C "
"Great album. Fantastic artist. Absolutely awful service (Google) why would 
you keep playing me the clean version. A clean version of Eminem (any song) 
sounds like tecnho with all the curse words span back. I clearly play the 
explicit version but it don't play it. It feeds me the useless garbage 
which Google has tottaly ruined. You should not edit any of Eminem music. 
Not one person on the planet would accidentally play him and be affended. 
Those people are too busy listening to Will Smith. You such Google. "
"He's fallen off, Dr dre help him up! Better than relapse, not as good as MMLP2. Exceedingly average. Drugs / 
not being angry anymore / too much emphasis on free styling has made his 
raps a lot less memorable. Still some really good moments which remind us 
why he's a GOAT, but overall not a great album :( "
"Great lyrics, weak beats. Em definitely revisits his shady days in most of the songs on this album 
but its lacking the beats. Lyrically, this album is one of his best but the 
beats are definitely lacking the punch. People are saying his flow is bad 
but I beg to differ. His flow on this album is new, which people seem to 
associate with bad. Decent album overall, great job from Shady records. "
"AMAZING! If you like Shady, you'll LOVE the song ""Vegas""! Has one of Em's best 
flows! Brilliant vocalization by Skylar Grey on the song ""Twisted""! Good to 
hear fresh lyrics from D12 aswell! Awesome content from Yelawolf, too! All 
in all, amazing compilation album! Definitely worth it! "
"Not quite sure about the ""variety club""! Yes, I'll definitely be buying the 
album, I do wish there was more of Eminem though. Discovered I also like 
Yelawolf too. "
"SHADYXV ANYTHING TO DO WITH EMINEM I LOVE I CANT WAIT TO BUY THE CD ON MONDAY WHEN 
IT COMES OUT IN HMV "
"mnm another great album..all fans will like..shame so many re releases..but 
all worthy..he delivers yet again.. "
"Massive Eminem Fan For the last 2 albums I have been disappointed, I'm probly critical as 
hell cause I was lucky enough to follow Marshall from day 1. Not a bad 
album, slaughterhouse and yelawolf are on fire on this album. D12 song is 
awesome! But overall I've come to dislike the flow of Eminem, he out raps 
the beat, trying to squeeze every word and syllable in as much as he can. 
Sorry Slim! "
Brilliant Another of shady's bloody awesome albums 
"The songs dont stand out that much But are more of a look back into the past of shady records as a label 
showcasing their great songs "
"it's rather ok I'd say I am a really big fan of Eminem and I basically love all of his music, but 
honestly this album is not as appealing to me as I hoped it would be. 
though the lyrics might be quite good in his songs I don't really like the 
beats he chose for the tracks so ya a little bit disappointed especially if 
you compare it to older albums, but still worth the money, just not quite 
my taste you know. "
A few older tracks All good songs but a few were just re-releases of old ones 
I haven't got it yet but I can tell its good Ihave all eminems albums I cant wait 
"Awesome album Still lyrically killing it, why is ""twisted"" not a single??? "
"... I don't really care that there's some old tunes on here coz all that 
matters is it's all worth it if it's coming from shady "
That's why they call him Slim Shady because he's back......always delivers 
"RAP GOD Greatest rapper alive. This album is worth every penny. Love it. Some 
people saying re-releases on the album i guess they don't know its a 
GREATEST HITS album to celebrate 20years. "
"Different... It's a good album, but just not eminems style "
"Great but i can't buy anything from market because it's like i live in

Good music but there missing most the songs off the album so don't buy it 
"Rap God! EMINEM was the best and still the 
best!(iggy,macklemore,drake,........)GFY! "
"Eminem is the rap god Never makes a song that you don't love, a true legend <3 "
"Good The only good songs are the em songs the rest not so good but still OK. I 
only listened to snippets so maybe it will be good "
"Good Good to hear eminems new songs but I don't like the 2th cd as there all 
old songs but the last one but the new songs r really good if u like eminem "
Album with value Nice collection of tracks from lowkey artists by today's standards 
":D Love you Eminem amazing . Can't wait to see what your plans are for next

"Shadyxv Eminem as good as ever . Cant go wrong with a shady album . Very deep rap 
not the usual slim shady stuff . Still epic tho "
"Shady XV i've listened to the cypher and snippets and this album will be the return 
of shady. "
"Amazing I love it, I just wish there were more new songs "
LEGEND Greatest rapper alive no one will ever come close to slim shady #1 Eminem 
"All em traxx are awesome, vegas rocks Wat a tune "
"Awesomeness I love that Kelly is so real and true...I enjoy listening to great talent! 
All songs are wonderful creations! "
"Amazing album and Tokio Hotel fans read This is a great piece of work from Kelly. She's back to form and claiming 
her place as one of if not the best voice in pop music. As for Run Run Run, 
Tokio Hotel didn't write that song they just recorded it. That's why 
they're not mentioned. Covers happen thousands of times a year. If they 
were the songwriters they'd be credited as such but they're not. "
"Awesome I love her, she's beautiful CAN EVERY JUST SHUT Up ABOUT RUN RUN RUN It's 
just one song, so if you hear to hate on one song, just LEAVE "
"One of the best albums and most beautiful songs I have ever heard Piece by piece is by far one of the best written emotional songs of all 
time great work again Kelly and let nothing get you down "
Peice by peice That's where I'm at in my life . It hit home really hard . 
"Another Musical Work of Art Amazing how great artists like Kelly Clarkson can come up with new sounds 
that keep music fresh, interesting, and exciting. I LOVE this new CD!!! I 
can't believe how her sound keeps improving! I love to discover new music 
and wasn't even anticipating a new release since she is now a mother but 
she kept it going. Congratulations Kelly. The single Piece by Piece was 
well written and from the heart. "
"Amazing Kelly is my top 3 she is real with an amazing voice I love her so much 
this album has love songs that make u smile when u think of that special 
someone and songs that remind u of the pain others have left it has it all "
"Shattered Prisma This album is inspiring and heart felt, it's somewhat reminiscent of 
2013's Prismatic album from Katy Perry. But where that album fails, this 
one succeeds. This album needs to be a little more upbeat. I found some 
songs unenjoyable as some felt repetitive. This album is well out together, 
even if in some areas, it shattered. "
"Loved this album! I saw someone mentioned this was more of a mellow album and yeah, it is, 
aside from a few upbeat songs (which are amazing!) But the lyrics are very 
powerful and personal and more than one of these songs made me cry. It 
could be that I'm an emotional sap and her songs from this album really 
resonate with me. Anyway, 5 stars! Worth the buy. "
"Love! Love! No matter what mood her albums are, I always love them. This one 
definitely didn't disappoint! "
"Voice of a generation Followed Kelly Clarkson since American Idol. She has not disappointed & 
has continued to be extraordinay in her vocal range & pure talent. Great 
album, every track is worth the price of admission. Piece by piece is 
inspiring, nice words. "
"I love her music, I'm just not thrilled that only in the USA can you 
receive the free albums. If you live anywhere else like Canada you are out 
of luck. "
Kelly's best album to date. Every single song is amazing. I'm speechless. 
"Like it I realllyyy love Heartbeat song, someone, and war paint~ i love her voice 
shes so talented. :) "
"Amazed I have always been a fan of her since day 1!! She has never let me down 
when it comes to personal music!! Kelly is one of a kind! She does not 
follow anyone in order to be a awesome artist she does her own thing!! This 
is what makes kelly a great artist! "
"Best ever way better than taylor swift but she is a good singer too my mom 
loves you and me too best album ever made by you "
Amazing! Kelly is amazing as always! Love this lady! Awesome album! 
"A couple good songs But songs like ""Take you high"" is awful plus her singing doesn't have ""All 
I ever wanted"" power. Kinda weak "
"No variation I find it having no variation. Piece by piece not that great. Easy answer, 
""go make an album so the rest can bad mouth you,"" yes, I know. Call it as 
its heard. "
"Another hit from the first American Idol Yet another awesome album from the very first American Idol. Got to be 
honest don't think there is an album from Kelly that is bad. "
Great songs Love her. Her songs just get better and better. 
Amazing Voice is still evolving! I can't say enough about this album. 
"Beautiful person inside and out Thank you Kelly for sharing your heart and soul through your music. You 
are such a blessing in my home xoxo "
"Not the radio version I wish I could get my money back. I thought this version was going to be 
slower like on the radio. All the music in the background diss distracts 
the feeling of the song. "
"Excellent So many songs to love, sing out loud and to cry to. Way to go Kelly!!! "
Welcome back Kelly it's been too long since your last smash hit! 
Listen to the preview This sounds like a good album from Kelly Clarkson. Thumbs up! 
"Long time fan Been a fan since she was on Idol. Her music is always something to look 
forward to! "
"She had a baby girl this week! And that little girl is going to need lots of toys so everyone buy her 
album! "
"AWESOME×10 Kelly sounds so pure, so soulful, every song she creates, you can feel in 
your heart and soul. She is a brilliant star in a galaxy of stars half as 
bright! "
"Magnifique Juste magnifique cet album.... T'es vraiment good Kelly. Luv u and ur 
Music. "
That is an amazing song and touches my heart in so many ways 
"Run run run has anyone listened to the ORIGINAL of Run, Run, Run by Tokio Hotel? No? 
Did you even know they had this song on their album last year? No, probably 
not. Go listen to that version. No hate to Kelly and John, this version is 
nice. I just hate the Bill, Tom, Georg, and Gustav got absolutely NO credit 
for that song. "
"In The Blue, Dance With Me, Good Goes The Bye. "
I was pleasantly surprised. Must have masterpiece. Every song is so good. 
Standard Kelly. I downloaded Good Goes the Bye so far. 
"More than a song This is very moving. It left me weeping and speechless. I am in awe 
listening to the vulnerable lyrics. "
I love Kelly Clarkson Im such a fan of her work 
"Love Kelly! Each year she just gets better and better. More life experiences and more 
writing/creating songs of it. One of my favorite singer/songwriters EVER. "
"Always great Some songs I had to give a chance but over all love kelly so totally worth 
every cent "
"Awesome This was 1 of his pretty good albums but he needs to stop talking bout 
weed it's getting boring "
"The king of corporate sellouts Wiz Khalifa as an artist uses the most stale, played out production you 
can find. He couldn't write a decent verse with any substance to save his 
life. His corporate overlords have more control over his music than he 
does. Only pick up if you're a white suburban teenager who smokes hella 
kush whose parents just don't get them and who suffers from crippling white 
guilt. The fact this is under ""Hip Hop Fundamentals"" is insulting to the 
genre. "
"Blacc Hollywood Its a pretty great album I have the deluxe version you get more its the 
wiz id expect. "
"Bring back old Wiz This new stuff is terrible. Way too much singing. His mix tape ""28 Grams"" 
blows this album out the water. Wiz please stop singing and lay down some 
killa...also this sounds a lot like ""Rolling Papers"".. Which was terrible 
except for one or two songs. "
Lame Wiz is lame. The pothead routine is played out and his sound is just as... 
"its kool I dnt like this album as much but Im only givn u 3stars cuz im a big fan 
of ur music hoping ur next album is wiz worthy "
"Wiz Khalifa Blacc Hollywood It was okay, I liked some of the songs, it just got boring because almost 
all he talked about was weed "
"To all the haters U may say he sucks but if he sucked then he wouldn't be making twice of 
what u make "
Younge khalifa man I love all the songs. My favorite is no gain 
ALBUM OF THE YEAR! The best album I've ever bought.
