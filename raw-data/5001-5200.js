Full of many different tempos, vocalizing styles, soft and hard \nspeeds, this is Disturbed at their Nostalgic peak. If you are a metal fan, \nor just getting into rock, it doesn't matter. It has something for \neveryone. Ballads, screams, heartbreak and despair, love gone wrong and \nlove gone right. In other words, you would be a fool no to try this one. I \njust found this song, and A SOUND OF SILENCE is probably THE BEST COVER \nDISTURBED HAS DONE!!! IT is AMAZING!!! You have done the impossible \nDisturbed, you have revived a slowly fading rock genre. Keep doing great \nguys, you have a lifelong listener born today. Give it a try.
