I have loved them since the first \ntime I say them on the sing off. But this feels like the sell out album. \nWhich is great for them but it's not just the 5 of them. The use of extra \nsound effects (reverbs and such). It's not the roots they came from and \nmakes me a little disappointed. Still good and worth supporting them. Just \nfeel this is the beginning of the end of 5 talented people making pure \nacapella music. "

  {
     text:"A Must Buy! I am just going to tell you that this is an EXCELLENT and AMAZING album! \nYou must buy it and here are three points why: 1. It is Pentatonix! 2. It \nis acapella (which is amazing)! And 3. It is a lot of original work! There \nare three reasons and should you need more then you need to just buy it \ninstead of over thinking it.

Scott, I love the rasp in your voice in Sing! \nAlso, Kevin, can I just say....wow, loved your part too. Mitch, you're \nalways spot on and fantastic and wonderful and..and..I could go on forever. \nKirsty, Water is SO good! It's a perfect showcase of your voice.

You can tell it's professionally produced–I feel like it takes some of the \nclear-cut distinctness away from their sound.They sounded Raw, with their \npure voices,and it was unbelievable.This album doesn't sound as raw,but \nit's still a beautiful. PTXVol III had more of a pop feel to it:whereas \nthis album does have several peppy and fun pop songs,it seems to have more \nof a demure, hauntingly beautiful theme.Happy with my purchase.Will \nprobably annoy my roommate for the next month listening only to this. :) "

I highly recommend listening to the second \npart of \"Perfect Circle/God Speed\" Mac says some deep stuff in the second \npart that'll make you say \"Wow\". You don't want to miss this masterpiece!
