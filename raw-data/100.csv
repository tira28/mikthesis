"Every one has a different opinion Sorry but I am not a fan I mean every song is the same - break up songs all 
the time I mean come on its like u have dated every guy in the world sorry 
but don't like u a lot "
"Your right U no all those people who said she was much more talented when she was all 
country your right. She belongs to country not pop. Mostly everyone says 
that she is stealing pop fame from katy Perry , one direction and all those 
other pop artists. She should be queen of country not queen of pop and I 
really didn't like the shake it off vid "
"Taytay Well I do really love Welcome To New York and Blank Space. Those two are 
definitely my favorite I cannot agree with her change in music. Hate me 
all you want but you all got at least three stars "
"Wow I am a big fan of Taylor swith and I like the country songs and pop I 
think there is nothing wrong with you. MY 3 FAV SONGS ARE BLANK SPACE, 
SHAKE IT OFF AND STYLE. "
"nice going swiftie THIS. ALBUM. IS. SICK. SWIFT, I don't know how Taylor does it. she is fab. 
I don't know what IT is but she's got IT. Let's go taytay let's go. U go 
girl u r doing a awesome job out there. I u and . Shake those haters off 
girlfriend because we got u r back. Btw u have got the cutest cats ever "
"I think we need to keep in mind ...this sound is so polished and clean that I don't think we could expect 
such perfection from anyone else. Especially Style. Oh, wowie "
"Seriously? The people who say she should go back to country are so wrong 
because she has more fans than ever and she is adding some Taylor Swift 
into pop not just country. "
"Yep Taylor is changing. It's been a long many years of being rich and famous 
before this album was written. She keeps going. She doesn't take a break. 
This is (turn the page) the next chapter. We should enjoy it and most of 
all be excited for it. "
"It's good but... I like most of the songs but this album could defiantly use some 
improving. I love that she's not caring about what the haters say. Boo 
Harry boo! "
"Any one who says that her country music is better well that's your opinion so 
don't go saying that she is stealing the fame from other pop singers because 
she isn't she earned her way to the top. She is talented in pop and country 
so don't just go rating it 1 star and dissing on her music. HOW RUDE!! "
"Couldn't be any better! This album is by far the BEST! I love her music because I can relate to 
what she sings.. totally worth it! ❤❤ "
"OMG IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER! I Love This Album SO Much There Is Not One Song I Dislike. I Think Taylor 
Swift's Pop Music Is Awesome!! "
"OMG TAYLOR SWIFT IS MY EVERYTHING I WANNA MEET HER SO BAD IM HER BIGGEST FAN I LISTEN TO HER SONGS EVERY 
DAY!!! "
"Taylor Swift!! Really love her 2 songs ""Shake it Off,"" and ""Blank Space!!"" I haven't 
really heard the others yet. "
"Wow AWESOME!!!!! Don't listen to them you're awesome, I'm one of your fan,, 
keep going. I bet one day you'll be the best and I'll encourage you! "
"Amazing new album!! I have been a fan of taylors for almost 3 years! Every year her song just 
keep getting better and better! Fantastic new album, can't wait to see u 
perform live in December!! "
"Love it I love Taylor's music get this app if u like Taylor's music you will love 
it I Taylor she is good at country and pop music so if u don't think that 
something is wrong with you cause she is good at music I her music GET 
IT!!!!!!:-) ;-) "
"All Taylor swift songs!!! This album is good but....WHY DID SHE CHANGE FROM COUNTRY TO POP..!!!Her 
country music has been awesome. Her pop vids (some of them)Are so weird! She 
should change back to COUNTRY!!! "
"AMAZING! Taylor just keeps getting better and better...and what I love the most is 
she doesn't have to be raunchy and use sex to sell her music like every 
other artist today. Would love to meet her, never thought there would be 
someone else as weird as me & has a cat obsession..bahah "
"Wildest dreams Beautiful, & I've dedicated this song to a very special someone whom I 
miss terribly! Love to Eu "
"Worst song known to man If u like this song u have no life and no taste in music. The world would 
be a much better place without it. Gayest, crapiest, most horrible song 
ever. "
"Hmmm I just don't get it....I feel like I'm 9 again listening to oops I did it 
again...yuck...don't get me wrong there are a few good songs but yea her 
country was so much better...don't no wat happened to ya Taylor not so 
swift little disappointed "
"I actually love it! I find it soooo ironic that many TS fans are saying they hate or dont like 
this new album for sounding like trash, etc. Thats because I have NEVER 
been a Taylor Swift fan, never could get into her music, yet I actually 
really like this. I'm not even heavy into pop either. The only songs I'd 
take off this album if I could are Welcome to New York, All You Had to Do 
Was Stay, Bad Blood, and I Know Places. Otherwise is great! Fave songs here 
are Clean, I Wish You Would, Style, This Love and Wildest Dreams. "
Sorry to say I've never payed for music before this! I can't get this song out of my head :) 
"Sorry Taylor but I'm disappointed. I really like some of these songs but she lost too much of why I came to 
like her music. She was always very original and had catchy lyrics and 
sounds. Red was her best album to date. I liked where that was going but 
then she jumped off the bridge with this album. Now she sounds like 
everything else. Boring and unoriginal. "
"Its sad.... Everyone on here is saying how country taylor used to be. Get a 
clue.....country isnt country anymore. The 90's were the last decade of 
true country. The music we call country today is just as much pop as 
taylor's new album. GET OVER IT. Kudos to taylor !!! Great album. "
"Love it! Who cares what the haters say. Everyone is allowed to change even 
TSwift!! Love her new album... Style, I Know Places, Wildest Dreams, Clean, 
& Blank Space are my absolute favourite songs♡☆♡☆ "
"Seriously I am a 100% swiftie and I just want to say that those people who are 
saying that Taylor needs to switch back to country is wrong and those 
people that are saying she needs to stay with pop is wrong too because 
Taylor is Taylor she can stick with pop or she can stay with country she 
can even do both its her decision she can pick which ever she wants so 
instead of saying she needs to do this you should be supportive of what she 
chooses Taylor can be the queen of country pop AND I'M TALKING TO ALL YOU 
SWIFTIES "
"Finally taking to her ACTUAL sound! Taylor Swift has never been country and never will be. Her sound has 
always been pop and I'm so happy she finally took to her pop roots. all 
those past country songs or as pop as they get. I don't know how you guys 
listen to country, but in the south we listen to Tim McGraw, Blake Shelton, 
George Strait, Johnny Cash, Miranda Lambert, Shania Twain etc. while I'm at 
it Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, and all those new fake country artists need to 
stop making country into some kind of drunken scene for teens. "
"Great album I don't know what i expected from Taylor Swift and her crossover album but 
it is a fantastic album however, I find really unfortunate that her bonus 
songs aren't available with this album purchase or as individual songs. "
"Her music isnt the same anymore. Very bad tracks, no more good lyrics and her panting when singing she had 
no good voice, better listen to Shania twain. "
"Love it I love this album,i lov taylor,if u guys have notting nice to say then 
dont say anything➕ur awsome taylor dont have to listen to the haters they 
just hate, ur the best taylor "
"Good songs Love Style,Shake It Off,Blank Space;Wildest Dreams n Bad Blood luv ya 
T-Swizzle "
"I WOULD LISTEN TO THIS EVERY DAY!!! Don't like song numbers 9, 10, 11, and 13. But every other song leaves me 
completely breathless! "
"Totes awesomsause! I mean who dosent like Taylor Swift?? Who thinks that is the lamest person 
ever. "
"Just amazing!! OMG I LISTENED TO DIS ALBUM EVERYDAY WHENEVER I CAN ITS THE WORLD TO ME 
=). My fav so far is out of the woods and blank space "
"Awesome Music Taylor Swift is the best!!! Don't let people be mean to you. I love Blank 
Space, Bad Blood, Style, and Shake it Off. "
"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS ALBUM AND ALL OF YOU WHO SAY ITS TRASH WELL GUESS 
WHAT YA'LL ARE TRASH DONT EVEN HATE ON TAYLOR SWIFT BECAUSE SHE CAN SING 
BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU INCONCIEDED PEOPLE. THIS ALBUM SHOWS HOW AMAZING SHE 
REALLY IS "
"Speechless. Every time. There have been few artists capable of making the transition between 
genres like Swift. That said, she herself raised the bar on her music, 
something she does exceptionally well. There is no doubt that her music 
continues to excel exponentially. Taylor Swift knows no boundaries, nor 
limits. "
"Best yet!!! I love that she's breaking out of her shell. T swift is growing up but not 
straying away from HER sound! "
"Ed Sheeran is just the most amazing artist ever. I clicked on ""one"" and 
within the first three words I had chills. Love him♥ "
"ED SHEERAN IS AMAZING Wow. his upbeat songs make me wanna jump and his slow songs make me wanna 
find someone close. His song Thinking Out Loud is my new favorite song. "
"NO NEED TO LISTEN IT'S ALREADY A 5★ Every time he drops an album I always end up in a relationship and I hate 
how he almost does he music with me specifically in mind. He just knows me 
so well smh love Ed Sheeran. The man is a genius "
"Amazing One of my favourite albums. I bought + and thought it was great. But then 
I got x and loved it. Always been a great fan of Ed Sheeran and can't wait 
to see him in October. "
"Impressive 2nd assault Was a little suspicious that the influences of pharell and the other dude 
who's name I forget would sully the strong songwriting of ed . But not a 
bit of it .. fantastic album. "
"X Absolute genius his lyrics create love and loving relationships you knock 
em out ed I will knock em up lol "
"Ed Sheeran, you've done it again! I have listened to this album over and over again since september and I 
can't stop listening! A lot of people are saying its the same thing over 
and over again, meeting a girl, describing what you did together, that is 
all they think it is, but its not, is a fantastic album with an amazing 
collection of songs, that I can't stop listening to! I have proved that its 
not just teenage girls who love this album, its also teenage boys. "
"Having a problem The album is gd but one problem I accidentally deleted Google music player 
and I downloaded it again and I look on this album and it said that I paid 
for it but it won't let me play it and it says I got no music if someone 
could help me It would be great cause I am really upset. It also says that 
it unavailable. But I don't understand why I paid and everything it just 
won't work "
"Ed sheeran is a true ★ I love each and one of his song I love him ♥♥ listen to it. It is awesome 
and so sweet the slow songs and the upbeat ones make you want to dance "
"Ed ur the best I love your songs my favorite is don't great songs,your a awesome 
singer,love your songs.wait a sec not just me millions of people. Keep the 
awesomeness going Ed "
"X' traordinary! Amazing, absolutely amazing. Such a beautiful album from such a beautiful 
artist. <3 "
"I'm in love I love ed he is such a genius! Every verse and every song just gets better 
and better. I love his voice and his unique style. He is definitely one of 
my favorites. "
"Incredible Album!! Ed Sheeran has an amazing voice and he writes songs to show that off!! His 
lyrics touch me a such an emotional level. It's always great listening to 
him!!! "
"Blew it again Once again another album with a couple of good tracks and a lot of rubbish 
to make the little girls (judging by the other comments) get all excited. 
""He knows me so well"" really? You're a teenage girl, the only people that 
don't know you are you're parents. Kudos for Sing & Dont though, but the 
rest, like his first album, utter drivel!! "
"Just Happy.... He puts a smile on my face, makes my ears so happy to be listening. And 
his words fill my heart. Lyrics that touch me deep. What's better than 
that? "
"Simply best... Ed can absolutely sing... sing the best Absolutely best voice and singer out there. Plus one great songwriter ;) 
...for all 1D fangirls, u gotta LOVE HIM, he writes texts for 1D songs "
"Amazing love love love this! Ed Sheeran will always be my all time favorite 
artist, so creative with lyrics and love all the different styles! "
"Love it! Was skeptical if I would like his other music than what plays on the 
radio. Was surprised. Very good variety of brit pop, alternative rock and 
rap. So versatile and talented! "
"Love him His voice is so good I wish he would sing that to me on my birthday. I'm 
turning 11in June 11 is my birthday I live in Michigan but who cares his 
amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!!! I even had chills up and every were 
in me. I almost cried at the begging of the song. It was so romantic "
"His music make my heart feel again... I'm not usually a sensitive person but his songs,his music just melted my 
heart... "
"LOVE HIM LOVE HIM LOVE HIM LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!!! Have his + album in my cd player 2 I 
would recomend everyone loving ed sheeran peace and L.O.V.E baby "
"Absolutely perfect! I love ed sheeran and his music. My sister's first 
dance song is thinking out loud and i always cry when i listen to it "
"just okay THINKING OUT LOUD was the hit. So annoying and overplayed, but thats not 
his fault. Sing and don't were a pretty great. All the rest sounded from 
just ok, to thinking out loud (I really hate that song.) He has a good 
voice, but I really can't connect with him personally. "
"Thinking out loud Awesome,akickass hit. Its perfect for any setting. I feel him. My heart 
moves on this song.It is heart thobing. He,s great. Well done. "
"Ed sheeran is.the GREATEST I have not heard a song by him I dont like honestly, ive learned many of 
his songs on guitar and play them them for my friends around the fire, 
arkansas for ya "
"True Musical and Lyrical Genius Ed's music never fails to leave me speechless and this album is no 
exception. He is different than everyone else in the music industry, he 
truly loves what he does and his lyrics show that and he has a way of 
making you feel emotions you didn't even know could be felt. He doesn't do 
it for fame, he simply does it because he loves it and he likes to make 
people happy. SO much respect to this man. He is a true legend. I will 
forever support him in everything that he does. Infinite stars for Ed 
Sheeran. "
"Ed Freaking Sheeran I haven't even listened to this whole album yet and I know it's a 5 star 
album (; "
"Seriously? After being completely in love with his first album I really wanted this 
to be good. This is a completely honest review.. Belive me. Well let's look 
at the positives first... Sing was a good song and you've probably got 
bored to death of it by now. Right on to the negatives every song is about 
the same thing... He meets a girl and he describes the things they did 
together.. every.. single.. song... Oh you want more? Well tough he ran out 
of ideas after he made his first album. So yeah that was a £5 wasted. The 
only people who are going to enjoy this are teenage girls that are so in 
love with Ed Sheeran that no matter what he says or does he will always be 
'perfect'. "
"I'm in love He's one of best artists of our time and he's just incredible. His last 
album was boss as well. The fact that he can write, sing, rap, beat box and 
play the quitar at the same time is just incredibly impressive. His lyrics 
are so deep and hits you in the heart. Ed is so down to earth and a great 
person and I love him. Great job ed. "
"Love him He has lots of amazing songs but number 11 (thinking out loud) is the best 
it makes me want to cry "
"What an album! I'd hate to know how many times I've listened to this album. Fantastic! 
There is a wonderful variety of songs from powerful ballades, romantic love 
song and move melodic rap with a heavy hiphop influence. There truly is a 
sobg for every occasion on this album. Lyrically this album is the best 
I've ever heard. Ed sings about the struggles of life on tour, the pain of 
loosing a family member, and all while falling in and out of love. I have 
also head this album played love and it too surpassed my expectations "
"What real music is. If you want to listen to something with depth and meaning, this is the 
album for you. If your tired of this lame rap music we have today that 
literally Is *beep* that *beep* I got all this money *n*gga* blah blah then 
THIS IS DEF the album for you! Ed is literally beyond talented and gives me 
hope that the music industry has not completely gone down the drain. I hope 
whoever listens to this album really does enjoy it, its so good! "
"Excellent Brilliant album. As with +, the released songs are the worst ones on it, 
not to say they're bad. It is a little bit samey as + but in the best way 
possible. Some lovely songs on there. Personal favourites being Thinking 
Out Loud, Tenerife Sea and Afire Love. "
"Speaks to my soul When I first heard thinkin out loud it was like I was listening to my own 
thoughts it was amazing and how they used an old famous bass line and 
transformed it into a great song blows my mind. "
"Love it !!! I ♥ Ed Sheeran sooo much, listen to this album coz YOLO ( u only liv once) 
my fav song is SING xxx "
"I very much enjoy Ed's music - it's a very interesting variety compared to 
many pop musicians on the radio today. ""Thinking Out Loud"" and ""Afire Love"" 
are two favorites - call me a sap, but the former is wonderful to dance to! "
"OMG I got + and I didn't think anything could be better. But x is just 
amazing! Afire love is by far my favourite song ever and I love the album 
sooooooooooooooo much! Keep making amazing songs edd;) "
"Love His Music He has an amazing voice I love him besides the fact that he is totally 
cute I especially love thinking out loud "
"I love the cd, and tried to play it this morning and it sounds absolutely 
awful. I am so disappointed that I spent money on it. It sounds muffled and 
scratchy. I regret buying it from Google play. Terrible purchase. "
"Yeah... And? So I like Ed but there is nothing on this album that really stands out to 
me as genius or intelligent. Nothing new or boundary pushing. This is great 
music for ordering a pumpkin spice latte and Starbucks with your fellow 
hipster friends. It's a very uneventful 40 minutes if you ask me. Now Ed 
can sing and play for sure and he is incredibly successful which is great 
however, there is a difference between making successful music and making 
quality music. (This is my opinion) "
"OMG!! Sam has really killed it in every song that he has sang. He could sing the 
phone book and I would listen. Can't wait to hear his next album because I 
will be buying it! "
"Sam Smith I am a huge fan of Sam Smith I honestly don't care if he likes boys 
because its not about that its his singing its so beautiful and he's just 
so talented.<3 "
"Polished! Perfect... can't wait for more. I am really glad this album is still so 
popular and proud it has hardly depreciated because of that. "
"Oh Emm Gee I love sam smith he is like a male adele his whole album is about a guy he 
fell in love with and didnt love him back so sad i still love it though its 
got me through so really tough times ""stay with me""and "" Im not the only 
one""are my favorite thanks sam "
"This is how to fall in love!! His voice is just amazing, he's extremely talented; my best singer ever 
with any doubt. "
"Sam Smith❤ His songs are so inspirational and every single one of them tell a story. 
You can always hear the pain or even sometimes excitement in his voice when 
he sings. These songs are amazing. "
"He blows me away Great vocals but his heart in every song- Lay me down ..just melts ..its 
time we got some more great vocalists out there "
"SAM SMITH Sam smith is the best i love his music his voice is awesome and he has so 
much soul in his music he's the best i love the song like i can keep up the 
good work "
"I'm not the only one.... I have been through this, although it makes tears arise from my face I 
still love this song. "
"Good songs but... They're all so slow and depressing sounding and his singing in these songs 
sounds whiney. I just personally didn't like it "
"Sam Smith <3 <3 THANK YOU SAM!!! Sam Smith and his songs has always made me happy when i am sad Sam Smith 
has a voice were if he sang the phone book i would love it thank u so so so 
so so much Sam Smith i plan on seeing one of your concerts i am your most 
BIGGEST BIGGEST FAN EVER THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! Thank you for being there 
for everyone in your music that tuchs our hart i think i speak for everyone

there for your fans "
Amazing album love Sam Smith Amazing love the songs on there lay me down gives me running down tears 
"Love It Sam Smith is my Favorite Male Singer I love him so much Like he is a 
inspiration!! Plz Listen To Him Guys "
"Sam smith is the best I know all his songs if I ever saw him in real life I would pass out 
literally I don't think I would be able to live he and Ed sheeran are the 
best soul singers never underestimate them cause if you and Sam smith were 
in a singing contest no doubt that sam smith would win "
"sam smith in the lonely hour wow im loving this album he has such a amazing voice very powerfull voice 
especially love the song stay with me "
", ❤, , , , , ""Not In That Way,"" ""Lay Me Down,"" & ""I've Told You Now!!!!"" I've been following Sam Smith and am so glad to see him on top of the 
world and yet still able to remember the feelings that brought him to his 
knres when he wasnt straddling the universe with musical Giants & artistic 
legends! Well Done Sam! "
"His voice I have an obsession with his voice. To me it sounds like heaven. His voice 
is just soothing and amazing. "
"Wonderful His voice is soulful and full of emotion. Stay With Me is hard to beat, in 
my opinion. Love his delivery.. "
"I Love This Album !! This is is deep and emotional it's makes me feel like I'm about to cry 
every time I love Sam smith and his music and this is the best album I ever 
heard "
"OMG I love Sam Smith he is so good that I can't express my love for him I even 
have this album on CD love him so bae "
